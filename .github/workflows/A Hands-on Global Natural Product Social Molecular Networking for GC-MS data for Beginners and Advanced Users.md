# **A Hands-on Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking for GC-MS data for Beginners and Advanced Users**



### **Wednesday May 27th, 2020: 9am** 

ZOOM link: TBD



# **Audience**

The target audience is mass spectrometrists, researchers and non-researchers who use GC-MS. 



**Zoom Etiquette**

All participants will be muted upon entry. If you would like to ask a question, please send a message via chat. We can then unmute you to start a discussion. If you think weâ€™re going too fast, you can also select go slower/faster in the feedback options in the top right of the zoom meeting. There will be periods of time for questions.

### Summary

In this workshop, the participants will learn how to analyze gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) data using the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) analysis infrastructure ([https://gnps.ucsd.edu](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/)), including introduction to molecular networking.

Learning objectives

1. how to perform a GC-MS data analysis and molecular networking job on the GNPS web platform
2. how to browse results on the GNPS interface
3. how to explore spectral annotations
4. how to navigate and interpret molecular networks with Cytoscape



### Requirements:

A computer with an internet connection. 

Additionally, the following software will have to be installed: 

Cytoscape ([https://cytoscape.org](https://cytoscape.org/)), and a table editor (Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice, https://www.openoffice.org/).

***Note:** This free and open-source file archiver might be useful to unzip folders during the workshop [https://www.7-zip.org](https://www.7-zip.org/)
