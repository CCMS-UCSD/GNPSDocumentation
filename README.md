### Introduction to GNPS
Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS, [http://gnps.ucsd.edu/](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash2.jsp)) is a web-based mass spectrometry ecosystem that aims to be an open-access knowledge base for community-wide organization and sharing of raw, processed or identified tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrometry data. GNPS aids in identification and discovery throughout the entire life cycle of data; from initial data acquisition/analysis to post publication.

### Migration to the New Documentation

The GNPSDocumentation can be consulted at [https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/).

*Note*: Pardon our dust as we are migrating to this new documentation. During the transition, throughout the documentation we will be linking to our legacy documentation that is still relevant. Thank you for your patience.

### Contributing to the New Documentation

- For informations/feature request, please open an "Issue" [on the present GitHub repository](https://github.com/CCMS-UCSD/GNPSDocumentation/issues).
- To contribute to the GNPS documentation, fork the [*CCMS-UCSD/GNPSDocumentation*]((https://github.com/CCMS-UCSD/GNPSDocumentation)) repository, and make a "Pull Request" with your edits.

### Legacy Documentation

To checkout our legacy documentation in its entirely, you can find it [here](https://bix-lab.ucsd.edu/display/Public/GNPS+Documentation+Page).

### GNPS Workflows

GNPS Workflows are available on the following repository: [https://github.com/CCMS-UCSD/GNPS_Workflows](https://github.com/CCMS-UCSD/GNPS_Workflows)
