# Reanalysis of Data User Interface (ReDU)

## Summary
[ReDU](https://redu.ucsd.edu/) is a community- and data-driven approach to find and reuse public data containing tandem MS data at the repository scale. ReDU is a launchpad for co- or re-analysis of public data via the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking Platform [(GNPS)](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp). Our aim is to empower researchers to put their data in the context of public data as well as explore questions using public data at the repository scale.

**The full documentation can be found [here](https://mwang87.github.io/ReDU-MS2-Documentation/).**

**This is a community effort and everyone is encouraged to participate by submitting their own data and sample information [instructions](https://mwang87.github.io/ReDU-MS2-Documentation/HowtoContribute/). The sharing of new applications (and code) which use ReDU is highly encouraged.**

## Functions

### Analyze Your Data
[Compare Your Data to Public Data via Multivariate Analysis](https://mwang87.github.io/ReDU-MS2-Documentation/AnalyzeYourData_MultivariateComparisons/) - Projection of your data onto a precalculated principal components analysis score plot of public data. <br>
[Co-analyze Your Data with Public Data at GNPS](https://mwang87.github.io/ReDU-MS2-Documentation/AnalyzeYourData_CoAnalysis_at_GNPS/) - Select files using sample information and assemble public data in groups as desired using the file selector. Launching an analysis loads the files from [MassIVE](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp) at which point users can add their own data. The following co-analyses can be launched:
  * Molecular Networking at GNPS
  * Library Search at GNPS
  
### Analyze Public Data
[Explore Multivariate Analysis of Public Data](https://mwang87.github.io/ReDU-MS2-Documentation/AnalyzePublicData_MultivariateComparisons/) - Explore precalculated principal components analysis score plot of public data. <br>
[Explore Chemical Annotations and Associated Sample Information in all Public Data](https://mwang87.github.io/ReDU-MS2-Documentation/AnalyzePublicData_ChemicalExplorerSampleInformationAssociation/) - Precalculated using public data and default GNPS parameters <br>
[Re-analyze Public Data at GNPS](https://mwang87.github.io/ReDU-MS2-Documentation/PublicData_Reanalysis_at_GNPS/) - Select files using sample information and assemble public data in groups as desired using the file selector. The following co-analyses can be launched:
  * Molecular Networking at GNPS
  * Library Search at GNPS
  * Chemical Enrichment Analysis
  * Sample Information Association
 
## Data Availability
All sample information can be downloaded from the ReDU homepage by clicking "Download Database". The ReDU identification database is publicly available and accessible via GNPS/MassIVE (gnps.ucsd.edu), MSV000084206.
