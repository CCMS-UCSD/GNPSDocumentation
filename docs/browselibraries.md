## GNPS Community Spectral Libraries

The GNPS public spectral libraries can be browsed and explored in the browser. The list of all public spectral libraries is listed [here](GNPS LINK).

### GNPS Community Library

There are several spectral libraries available at GNPS. They are either imported from the community (e.g. [Massbank](LINK)), provided directly to GNPS as a large collection of annotated spectra (e.g. [Pesticide Library](LINK)), or aggregated from single MS/MS additions from the entire community (e.g. [GNPS-Community](LINK)).

Clicking on a library brings users to a list of all MS/MS spectra that are in that library. The most up to date annotation is listed.

### Most Recent Contributions

At the bottom of the list of all spectral library, the most recent contributions of annotation library spectra are listed in reverse chronological order. These generous contributions from members of the community are just the latest amongst the thousands of MS/MS spectra deposited at GNPS.
