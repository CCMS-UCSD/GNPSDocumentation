## GNPS Workflow Contact information

If you have any questions about how to use GNPS please first ask the community at the GNPS forum located [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/molecular_networking_bug_reports).

In the event that there is an issue with the GNPS website or workflows, please contact the administrators at [ccms-web@cs.ucsd.edu](ccms-web@cs.ucsd.edu).

For more in-depth assistance, we invite you to attend the numerous GNPS workshops we offer at UCSD and at conferences throughout the year.

If you would like to host a GNPS workshop together with the GNPS team, please reach out to the GNPS team (miw023@ucsd.edu). If you would like to organize your own GNPS workshop to train new users, please reach out to GNPS team (miw023@ucsd.edu) and we'd be happy to provide you with training and promotional materials.
