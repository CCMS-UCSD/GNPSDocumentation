## GNPS Workflow Contact information

If you have any questions about how to use GNPS please first ask the community at the GNPS forum located [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/molecular_networking_bug_reports).

In the event that there is an issue with the GNPS website or workflows, please contact the administrators at [ccms-web@cs.ucsd.edu](mailto: ccms-web@cs.ucsd.edu).

For more in-depth assistance, we invite you to attend the numerous GNPS workshops we offer at UCSD and at conferences throughout the year.

Upcoming workshops:

* Metabolomics 2018

If you would like to host a GNPS workshop together with the GNPS team, please reach out to the GNPS team [ccms-web@cs.ucsd.edu](mailto: ccms-web@cs.ucsd.edu). If you would like to organize your own GNPS workshop to train new users, please reach out to GNPS team and we'd be happy to provide you with training and promotional materials.
