## GNPS Workflow Contact information

If you have any questions about how to use GNPS please first ask the community at the GNPS forum located [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/molecular_networking_bug_reports).

In the event that there is an issue with the GNPS website, please contact the system administrators at [ccms-web@cs.ucsd.edu](mailto: ccms-web@cs.ucsd.edu).

For more in-depth assistance, we invite you to attend the numerous GNPS workshops we offer at UCSD and UCR and at conferences throughout the year. Check out the upcoming [workshops](workshops.md).

## GNPS Office Hours

We are hosting online office hours on a weekly basis online with Ming ([mingxun.wang@cs.ucr.edu](mainto:mingxun.wang@cs.ucr.edu), [Lab Website](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~mingxunw/)) via Zoom:

[https://ucr.zoom.us/j/98049645231](https://ucr.zoom.us/j/98049645231)

In office hours we'll cover new and old features of GNPS and most importantly we'll take your personal questions about GNPS, computational mass spectrometry, and any science you want to chat about! We'll start office hours given the time below and keep going until there are no more questions. If office hours get too busy, we will limit each question to 10 min.  

Upcoming Office Hour Schedule
