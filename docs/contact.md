## GNPS Workflow Contact information

If you have any questions about how to use GNPS please first ask the community at the GNPS forum located [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/molecular_networking_bug_reports).

In the event that there is an issue with the GNPS website, please contact the administrators at [ccms-web@cs.ucsd.edu](mailto: ccms-web@cs.ucsd.edu).

For more in-depth assistance, we invite you to attend the numerous GNPS workshops we offer at UCSD and at conferences throughout the year. Check out the upcoming [workshops](workshops.md).

## GNPS Office Hours

We are hosting online office hours on a weekly basis online with Ming ([miw023@ucsd.edu](mainto:miw023@ucsd.edu)) via Zoom:

In office hours we'll cover new and old features of GNPS and most importantly we'll take your personal questions about GNPS, computational mass spectrometry, and any science you want to chat about! We'll start office hours given the time below and keep going until there are no more questions. If office hours get too busy, we will limit each question to 10 min.  

Upcoming Office Hour Schedule

|     Date/Time    | Subjects Covered          |
| ------------- |------------- |
| 2PM PST (11PM CET) Weekly on Monday | GNPS Q and A |
| 9AM PST (6PM CET) Weekly on Tuesday | GNPS Q and A |

Please also take the time to RSVP that you're going to attend and what questions you may have so we know who to let in as well as what to expect and the order to address (you will not receive a confirmation from this RSVP, just show up to office hours once you add it):
