# IIN with XCMS-CAMERA

## Introduction

The use of XCMS and CAMERA to generate IIN relies on two custom utility functions (`getFeatureAnnotations` and `getEdgelist`) to extract and export MS1 based feature and edge annotations (i.e. grouping of features to adduct/isotope groups of the same compound). In addition, the utility function `formatSpectraForGNPS` is also used to export MS2 spectra.


## Development

These custom functions are available in the GitHub repository [https://github.com/jorainer/xcms-gnps-tools](https://github.com/jorainer/xcms-gnps-tools).

Representative R-markdown documents and python scripts are available on [http://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/fbmn-iin-xcms](http://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/fbmn-iin-xcms).

## Running the FBMN IIN workflow with XCMS-CAMERA

Step 1: Process your non-targeted LC-MS/MS data with XCMS-CAMERA following the [FBMN documentation guidelines](featurebasedmolecularnetworking-with-xcms3.md).

Step 2: Export the Supplementary Annotations/Pairs:

The use of XCMS and CAMERA to generate IIN relies on two custom utility functions:

`getFeatureAnnotations`: extracts and exports MS1 based feature annotation. It contains the adduct/isotope annotations generated by CAMERA.

`getEdgelist`: extracts and exports the Supplementary Pairs file that contains related pairs (i.e. from peak shape correlation analysis, etc) . 

Note that the utility function `formatSpectraForGNPS` of the FBMN must also be used to export MS2 spectra as MGF.

See our tutorial below for example.
