## Introduction

The Feature-Based Molecular Networking (FBMN) is a computational method that bridges popular mass spectrometry data processing tools for non-targeted LC-MS/MS and molecular networking analysis on [GNPS](http://gnps.ucsd.edu). The tool supported are: [MZmine2](https://mzmine.github.io/), [OpenMS](https://www.openms.de/), [MS-DIAL](http://prime.psc.riken.jp/Metabolomics_Software/MS-DIAL/), [XCMS](https://github.com/sneumann/xcms), and [MetaboScape4.0](https://www.bruker.com/products/mass-spectrometry-and-separations/ms-software/metaboscape/overview.html),
[XCMS](https://github.com/sneumann/xcms).

The main documentation for Feature-Based Molecular Networking is provided below.

## Mass Spectrometry Data Processing for the Feature Based Molecular Networking Workflow

In brief, mass spectrometry processing softwares have been adapted to export files that can be used with the Feature Based Molecular Networking (FBMN) workflow on GNPS. These softwares and their main features are presented in the table below, along with a step-by-step documentation to use for FBMN on GNPS (FBMN Documnetation):

**IMPORTANT:** The software use for the LC-MS/MS data processing have to be configured and utilized as recommended by the softwre documentation.


### Mass Spectrometry Data Processing with MZmine2 [RECOMMENDED]

Currently, we are recommending using the MZmine2 workflow, as it has been thoroughly tested. [See the documentation here](#featurebasedmolecularnetworking-with-mzmine2) and the following [video tutorial:](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/tutorials/americangutmzmine/)

## The Feature Based Molecular Networking Workflow in GNPS

There is a dedicated Feature-Based Molecular Networking workflow on GNPS that [can be accessed here](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/index.jsp?params=%7B%22workflow%22:%22FEATURE-BASED-MOLECULAR-NETWORKING%22,%22library_on_server%22:%22d.speclibs;%22%7D) (you need to be logged in GNPS first).

You will need three items (test files are accessible [here](https://github.com/CCMS-UCSD/GNPSDocumentation/tree/master/docs/tutorials/AG_tutorial_files)):

1. The Feature Table with the intensity of ion features.
2. The MGF file with the list of MS/MS spectra for the ion features.
3. [Optional] the Metadata table - described [here](networking#metadata)

#### Overview of the Feature Based Molecular Networking Workflow

#### Select the software used for the LC-MS/MS data processing

#### Set the parameters as needed
Coming soon for each parameters.

##### Set the advanced quantification parameters

There are several additional normalization options specifically for feature detection. We can normalize the features per LC/MS run and aggregate by groups with either a sum or average (recommended).
