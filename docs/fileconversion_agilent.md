## 1. Introduction

This page describes how you can convert and process your raw data from Agilent Mass Spectrometers to work with various GNPS tools. There are several paths depending upon your goals

1. Molecular Networking and qualitative comparison across multiple files using Classical Molecular Networking
1. Molecular networking and relative quantitate analysis across multiple files using Feature Based Molecular Networking

## Classical Molecular Networking

Here, one concern is the scan numbers and multiple collision energies present in many untargeted mass spec data from Agilent Instruments. It is recommended that users convert to MGF files using ...


## Feature Based Molecular Networking

We recommend converting with MSConvert filtering to a single collision energy and analyzing with MZmine.
