Huneck (Berlin Garden and Botanical Museum) provided by Harrie Sipman and Robert L??cking. The spectra were produced by three different LC-MS machines, ie and Agilent 6530 qToF (Pierre Le Pogam, University of Paris-Sud, University of Paris-Saclay, Joel Boustie, University of Rennes 1), a Waters Xevo G2-XS qToF (David Rondeau, Thomas Delhaye, University of Rennes 1) and a Thermo Q-Exactive Orbitrap (Jean-Luc Wolfender, Pierre-Marie Allard, University of Geneva). The LDB currently contains more than a thousand spectra across different machines, including diverse adduct spectra in addition to the [M+/-H]. The most common scaffolds in lichens are represented : depsidones, dibenzofuranes, pulvinic acids, paraconic acids, chromones, quinones, xanthones, monoaromatic compounds, quinones, xanthones and chromones. These spectra are not single energy but the consensus of spectra produced at different energies. For Agilent, these were 10, 25 and 40 eV in ESI-, (and also 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 eV for the more fragile depsides), and 5, 20 and 35 eV in ESI+ or APCI+ for terpenes. For Waters, the collision energies were 10, 20, 30 and 40 eV in ESI- and ESI+. The Thermo spectra were acquired using Normalized Collision Energy (NCE) based on the measured m/z value and three energies : 15, 30, 45 eV. |

The MS was automatically recalibrated every five injections in MS1 and MS/MS mode. |

| [View](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/gnpslibrary.jsp?library=GNPS-BILE-ACID-MODIFICATIONS) | Bile Acid Modifications Library  | This library consists of 21,549 MS/MS spectra of highest intensity from from the clustered spectra of public data on GNPS/MassIVE recovered using MassQL queries designed for non-, mono-, di-, tri-, tetra- and penta-hydroxylated bile acids. Based on delta masses from unmodified bile acids, the library accounts for 5,576 modified bile acids. Molecular formulae for the delta masses are provided as predicted by two in silico tools, BUDDY and SIRIUS, along with putative explanations when available. In addition, this library also contains MS/MS spectra from synthetic standards of 38 amino acids and 28 polyamines conjugated to bile acids. If the end-users are interested in using this spectral library for structure annotation, they are encouraged to carefully inspect the MS/MS spectrum, perhaps in comparison to the MS/MS spectrum of the conjugate portion proposed to be appended onto the bile acids (if available), to match reporter ions between the two spectra. A very careful manual interpretation of the presence/absence and ratio of ions by bile acid MS/MS fragmentation experts, along with retention time inspection, may facilitate distinction between regioisomers or stereoisomers. This spectral resource can provide unprecedented insights into the new biology of bile acids. Note: This library is not selected by default for search in GNPS and must be explicitly selected in the GNPS workflow from CCMS_SpectralLibraries/GNPS_Propogated_Libraries/GNPS-BILE-ACID-MODIFICATIONS |

The second library (i.e. NEO-MSMS_putative_lib) incorporates putative oxylipin and NEO-PUFA MSMS spectra derreplicated from oxidation experiments. Lastly, the collection features a version of the Watrous et al. oxylipin MSMS standards library (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2018.11.015) (i.e. NEO-MSMS_Watrous_lib). |

Fragmentation patterns for 73 authentic standards were collected using electrospray ionization in positive and negative polarity, and at multiple collision energies (20, 40, 60, and 80 eV CE) using a LC-QTOF. The resulting 320 MS/MS spectra are presented in PhenolicsDB , publicly available in GNPS and for download in .mgf and .nist format and use also at https://cooperstonelab.github.io/PhenolicsDB/. This library was created by Cristian Quiroz-Moreno (quirozmoreno.1@osu.edu) and Jessica Cooperstone (cooperstone.1@osu.edu).  |
