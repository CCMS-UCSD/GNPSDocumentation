# Welcome to GNPS

Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) is a web-based mass spectrometry ecosystem that aims to be an open-access knowledge base for community-wide organization and sharing of raw, processed or identified tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrometry data. GNPS aids in identification and discovery throughout the entire life cycle of data; from initial data acquisition/analysis to post publication.

As there are many aspects to GNPS, it can be a bit overwhelming, so the primary functionality is:

* Identification/Dereplication/Quantification of MS/MS data utilizing computational tools (e.g. Molecular Networking, Spectral Library Search, etc.)
* Give MS/MS spectra biological/environmental context by searching against all public MS/MS datasets
* Annotate/curate identified MS/MS spectra in open-access GNPS reference spectra libraries
* Publish entire study datasets with the Mass Spectrometry Interactive Virtual Environment (MassIVE) data repository
* Browse and Reanalyze over 700 public datasets at GNPS
* Automatic reanalysis of public datasets with automated reports of new identifications
* Explore identifications of public datasets across entire repository
