# Welcome to GNPS Documentation

Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS, [https://gnps.ucsd.edu/](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/)) is a web-based mass spectrometry ecosystem that aims to be an open-access knowledge base for community-wide organization and sharing of raw, processed or identified tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrometry data. GNPS aids in identification and discovery throughout the entire life cycle of data; from initial data acquisition/analysis to post publication.

As there are many aspects to GNPS, it can be a bit overwhelming. Here is a quick description of main functionalities:

### Analyze and Annotate

* Perform [molecular networking and spectral library search](gnpsanalysisoverview.md) of MS/MS data utilizing computational tools (e.g. [Molecular Networking](networking.md), [Spectral Library Search](librarysearch.md), etc).
* **NEW!** Perform advanced molecular networking and spectral library search with [Feature-Based Molecular Networking](featurebasedmolecularnetworking.md).
* [Annotate/curate identified MS/MS spectra](spectrumcuration.md) in open-access GNPS reference spectra libraries.
* Annotate peptidic natural products in MS/MS data with [DEREPLICATOR/VarQuest/DEREPLICATOR+](dereplicator.md) and [RiPPQuest](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-theoretical.jsp). <!--[MetaMiner](metaminer.md) , [CycloNovo](cyclonovo.md)-->
* Propagate in silico annotations in your MS/MS data with [Network Annotation Propagation (NAP)](nap.md).
* **NEW!** Search spectral Mass2Motifs in your MS/MS data [with MS2LDA](ms2lda.md).

### Share and Explore

* Publish entire study datasets with the Mass Spectrometry Interactive Virtual Environment (MassIVE) data repository ([Dataset Submission](datasets.md)).
* **NEW!** Give MS/MS spectra biological/environmental context by searching against all public MS/MS datasets ([MASST Search](masst.md)).
* [Browse](datasets#browsing-datasets) and [Reanalyze](datasets#reanalyze-datasets) over 700 public datasets at GNPS
* Automatic reanalysis of public datasets with automated reports of new identifications ([Continuous Identification](continuousid.md)).
* Explore identifications of public datasets across entire repository ([Molecule Explorer](moleculeexplorer.md)).

For more detailed information, read on in the documentation, checkout the [GNPS publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3597), and view some tutorial [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCufTdDIUPjfoN604Igv_29g/videos).

<!-- ## What is GNPS good for?

There are so many aspects to GNPS as it serves a diverse community. Here we wanted to highlight a few ways we think GNPS has been useful. We also highlight some of the creative ways the community has used GNPS's tools.

### Compound Identification (Dereplication)

Identify MS/MS spectra in your data to state of the art community MS/MS spectral libraries.

### Novel Analog Identification

We use GNPS's molecular networking to identify a novel analog of Stenothricin.

### Relative Quantification Across Samples

### Global Chemistry Visualization

When did we visualize stuff?

### Determine Biological/Chemical Context of Unknown Molecules



### Dataset Deposition for Publication

Today, the scientific community is clamouring for reproducibility of results that has resulted in cries for data transparency. Publications that lack public data are viewed with skepticism and rightfully so. GNPS is a place to deposit your data to in order to facilitate the review process as well as provide the community a resource to advance reproducible and rigorous science.

### Reference MS/MS Spectrum Publication for Re-identification

Put your MS/MS spectrum of a known compound in GNPS spectral libraries, so you never have to manually re-identify a compound in your own samples ever again. -->
