# Welcome to GNPS

Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) is a web-based mass spectrometry ecosystem that aims to be an open-access knowledge base for community-wide organization and sharing of raw, processed or identified tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrometry data. GNPS aids in identification and discovery throughout the entire life cycle of data; from initial data acquisition/analysis to post publication.

As there are many aspects to GNPS, it can be a bit overwhelming, so the primary functionality is:

* [Identification/Dereplication/Quantification](gnpsanalysisoverview.md) of MS/MS data utilizing computational tools (e.g. [Molecular Networking](networking.md), [Spectral Library Search](librarysearch.md), etc.)
* Give MS/MS spectra biological/environmental context by searching against all public MS/MS datasets ([MASST Search](masst.md))
* [Annotate/curate identified MS/MS spectra](spectrumcuration.md) in open-access GNPS reference spectra libraries
* Publish entire study datasets with the Mass Spectrometry Interactive Virtual Environment (MassIVE) data repository ([Dataset Submission](datasets.md))
* [Browse](datasets#browsing-datasets) and [Reanalyze](datasets#reanalyze-datasets) over 700 public datasets at GNPS
* Automatic reanalysis of public datasets with automated reports of new identifications ([Continuous Identification](continuousid.md))
* Explore identifications of public datasets across entire repository ([Molecule Explorer](moleculeexplorer.md))

For more detailed information, read on in the documentation, checkout the [GNPS publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3597), and view some tutorial [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCufTdDIUPjfoN604Igv_29g/videos).

<!-- ## What is GNPS good for?

There are so many aspects to GNPS as it serves a diverse community. Here we wanted to highlight a few ways we think GNPS has been useful. We also highlight some of the creative ways the community has used GNPS's tools.

### Compound Identification (Dereplication)

Identify MS/MS spectra in your data to state of the art community MS/MS spectral libraries.

### Novel Analog Identification

We use GNPS's molecular networking to identify a novel analog of Stenothricin.

### Relative Quantification Across Samples

### Global Chemistry Visualization

When did we visualize stuff?

### Determine Biological/Chemical Context of Unknown Molecules



### Dataset Deposition for Publication

Today, the scientific community is clamouring for reproducibility of results that has resulted in cries for data transparency. Publications that lack public data are viewed with skepticism and rightfully so. GNPS is a place to deposit your data to in order to facilitate the review process as well as provide the community a resource to advance reproducible and rigorous science.

### Reference MS/MS Spectrum Publication for Re-identification

Put your MS/MS spectrum of a known compound in GNPS spectral libraries, so you never have to manually re-identify a compound in your own samples ever again. -->

## Migration to New Documentation

Pardon our dust as we are migrating to this new documentation.

During the transition, throughout the documentation we will be linking to our legacy documentation that is still relevant. Thank you for your patience.
