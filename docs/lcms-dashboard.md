# LCMS Dashboard

Pardon our dust, this is a work in progress!

Help us by adding to it. 

This LCMS Dashboard Interface is designed to enable easy visualization of mass spectrometry data files directly in the browser. Broadly the data can come from the following sources:

1. MassIVE Public Datasets
1. GNPS Public Datasets
1. Metabolights Public Datasets
1. Metabolomics Workbench Public Datasets
1. GNPS Analysis Data Files (LC and GC)
1. PRIDE Proteomics Public Datasets
1. ProteomXchange Public Datasets

We aim to enable the visualization without having users download a single file and to easy share visualizations as a url with all settings preserved and saved. The high level capabilities are:

1. 2D mz vs RT Heatmap
1. XIC/EIC Plots of single and multiple files
1. TIC Plots of single and multiple files
1. Box Plots of XIC/EIC integration between two cohorts of samples
1. Interactive Feature Finding with MZmine2 and Dinosaur
1. Visualization of MS1/MS2 spectra within mass spec files

## Selecting Input Data

### Supported Input Data File Types

1. mzML
1. mzXML
1. CDF
1. Thermo RAW

## 2D m/z RT Heatmap

Lorem Ipsum

## XIC/EIC Plots
Obtain single or multiple XIC/EIC plots for one or more files

!!! note
    Default integration type is AUC but options MS1 Sum or MAXPEAKHEIGHT exist under XIC Integration Type dropdown menu
1. Drag and drop files or input USI links
1. Specify m/z or multiple m/z separated by ";" under XIC Options
1. Export or view your XIC values under XIC Integration  
1. Share or save your work by clicking "Link to these plots" or copy the link address
