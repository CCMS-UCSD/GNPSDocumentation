## MetaboScape Export for GNPS

This step-by-step tutorial describes the workflow to integrate MetaboScape 2.0 with Global Natural Products Social molecular networking web-platform (GNPS, http://gnps.ucsd.edu), and Sirius (https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/). This integration was made possible by creating an exporting module in MetaboScape, that allows to create from the processed data: (1) molecular networks and (2) matching against MS/MS spectral libraries available on GNPS. This module and this tutorial were prepared in collaboration with Dorrestein Lab at the University of California, San Diego.

**The key benefits offered by the GNPS-Trinity workflow are:**
1. Mapping back the intensity of the LC-MS feature detected across samples as pie chart diagram directly into the molecular networks for semi-quantitative purpose.
2. Discriminating isobaric compounds in molecular networks.
3. Mapping the in silico annotation generated by Sirius (https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/) into the molecular networks.

**Requirements:** 
1. Windows 7 64-bit for MetaboScape 2.0. 
2. A valid licence for MetaboScape 2.0.
3. The 'GNPS Export bundle for MetaboScape 2.0'. Please contact esi.support@Bruker.com to obtain the mandatory 'GNPS Export bundle for MetaboScape 2.0' and installation instructions.

**GNPS documentation:** 
Online documentation for GNPS web-platform is available [here](https://bix-lab.ucsd.edu/display/Public/GNPS+Documentation+Page) along with Youtube video tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCufTdDIUPjfoN604Igv_29g/videos).

## A. Profile Analysis
1. Open *Profile Analysis* and process your data following *Profile Analysis* documentation to generate the Bucket Table.
2. Define groups and/or attributes to enhance downstream data analysis (see **3.3.4** in **MetaboScape 2.0 tutorial**). The groups and/or attributes defined in *Profile Analysis* will be visualized in the molecular networks using pie chart diagram.
3. **IMPORTANTt**: Create one common group named 'SAMPLE' for all the samples. It will be used to enhance molecular networking visualization.
4. Export the Bucket Table to MetaboScape (see **3.1** in **MetaboScape 2.0 tutorial documentation**).

## B. MetaboScape
1. Open MetaboScape 2.0.
2. Open the project in MetaboScape (see **3.7** in **MetaboScape 2.0 tutorial documentation**).
3. Assign MS/MS spectra to the Bucket Table (see **3.7** in **MetaboScape 2.0 tutorial documentation**).
4. Sort buckets based on the presence of MS/MS.
5. Select only the buckets that have MS/MS associated with.
6. Perform *Automatic molecular formula generation using SmartFormula* (see **3.11.1** in **MetaboScape 2.0 tutorial documentation**) on these buckets. Make sure to select 'selected buckets only'.

## C. Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking
1. Go to GNPS (http://gnps.ucsd.edu).
2. Upload the .mgf file to GNPS following the documentation: https://bix-lab.ucsd.edu/display/Public/Input+File+Uploads.
3. Prepare a *Data Analysis* job.
    a. **IMPORTANT**: Make sure to untick *MS-Cluster*.
    b. **IMPORTANT**: Make sure to use *Minimum Cluster Size = 1*.
    c. Click on *Submit* to launch the *Data Analysis* job.
    d. Wait for the job to finish. Click [here](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=68a3320dd3f249db9416836329e17d1e) to view an example.

## D. Visualization of molecular networks with Cytoscape 
1. Open Cytoscape 3.4 (or more recent version).
2. Install the Cytoscape App *ChemViz2* - http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/chemviz2.
3. Import the molecular networking files downloaded from GNPS into Cytoscape.
    a. Import the network topology. Go to *File/Import/Network/File* - select the .pairsinfo file in *networkedges_selfloop* folder. See documentation for more details [here](https://bix-lab.ucsd.edu/display/Public/Cytoscape+3.4+Visualization+and+Analysis+Documentation).
