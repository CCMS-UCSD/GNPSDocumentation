## MetaboScape export for GNPS/Sirius module

This step-by-step tutorial describes the workflow to integrate MetaboScape 2.0 with Global Natural Products Social molecular networking web-platform (GNPS, http://gnps.ucsd.edu), and Sirius (https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/). This integration was made possible by creating an exporting module in MetaboScape, that allows to create from the processed data: (1) molecular networks and (2)  matching against MS/MS spectral libraries available on GNPS. This module and this tutorial were prepared in collaboration with Dorrestein Lab at the University of California, San Diego.

The key benefits offered by the GNPS-Trinity workflow are:
1. Mapping back the intensity of the LC-MS feature detected across samples as piechart diagram directly into the molecular networks for semi-quantitative purpose.
2. Discriminating isobaric compounds in molecular networks,
3. Mapping the in silico annotation generated by Sirius (https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/) into the molecular networks.

Requirements: 
- Windows 7 64-bit for MetaboScape 2.0. 
- A valid licence for MetaboScape 2.0
- The “GNPS Export bundle for MetaboScape 2.0” -> Contact           esi.support@Bruker.com to obtain the mandatory “GNPS Export       bundle for MetaboScape 2.0” and installation instructions.

GNPS documentation: Online documentation for GNPS web-platform is available [here] (https://bix-lab.ucsd.edu/display/Public/GNPS+Documentation+Page) along with Youtube video tutorials [here] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCufTdDIUPjfoN604Igv_29g/videos).

## A. Profile Analysis

1. Open Profile Analysis and process your data following Profile Analysis documentation to generate the Bucket Table.
2. Define groups and/or attributes to enhance downstream data analysis (See 3.3.4 in MetaboScape 2.0 tutorial). The groups and/or attributes defined in Profile Analysis will be visualized in the molecular networks using piechart diagram.
3. Important: Create one common group named ‘SAMPLE” for all the samples. It will be used to enhance molecular networking visualization.
4. Export the Bucket Table to MetaboScape (See 3.1 in MetaboScape 2.0 tutorial documentation).

## B. MetaboScape
1. Open MetaboScape 2.0
2. Open the project in MetaboScape (See 3.7 in MetaboScape 2.0 tutorial documentation).
3. Assign MS/MS spectra to the Bucket Table (See 3.7 in MetaboScape 2.0 tutorial documentation).
4. Sort buckets based on the presence of MS/MS.
5. Select only the buckets that have MS/MS associated with.
6. Perform Automatic molecular formula generation using SmartFormula (See 3.11.1 in MetaboScape 2.0 tutorial documentation) on these buckets. Make sure to select “selected buckets only”.
