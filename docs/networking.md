### Parameter Presets

## Online Exploration of Molecular Networks

These are the primary views to explore the molecular networks:

1. View All Clusters - All consensus MS/MS spectra created by MSCluster that were considered for library search and molecular networking. This does not include consensus MS/MS spectra that fell below the minimum cluster size threshold.
2. View Library Hits - All spectral library matches between consensus MS/MS spectra and the given libraries
3. View Spectral Families - List of all molecular network components. Each of these components can be visualized in-browser.
4. Networking Parameters and Written Description - Includes a written English description of parameters and tools used in the creation of the molecular network that can be included in a manuscript's methods section.
