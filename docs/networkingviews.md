## View All Clusters With IDs

View All Clusters allow a user to view the all consensus spectra in the molecular networking analysis.

This brings up all the input MS/MS spectra. To visualize each spectrum, we can click the "View Spectrum" button.

## View Spectral Families

View Spectra Families allows users to look at the molecular networks at a higher level. Users can see all the connected components. These connected components are all the nodes that are connected to each other. From here users can tell how big each component is, how many raw spectra are captured by the particular component, and also the libraries identifications of all the spectra in each component.

To visualize each network, click on the "Visualize Network" link
