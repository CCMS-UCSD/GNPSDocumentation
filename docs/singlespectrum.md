## Overview

Query a single MS/MS spectrum across all public GNPS datasets. The mass spectrometry equivalent of NCBI BLAST helps to put the query spectrum in context of where else it occurs as well as search a single MS/MS spectrum against all public spectral libraries.

## Workflow Selection

TODO: list

## Parameters

The query parameters are similar library search. Please refer to those parameter. TODO: link out

## Results

Query results are separated into two categories, spectral library search and GNPS dataset queries. Spectral library search results are presented in a similar fashion as the batch library search workflow, please refer to that documentation.

The top scoring match within a dataset is listed in the "TODO" view. The quality of the match can be inspected by clicking the "specplot" icon at the left of each row. Additionally, TODO.
