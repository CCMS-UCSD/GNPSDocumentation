# Sirius

## Introduction

Sirius is an in silico analysis tool developed by the [Bocker Lab](https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/).

## GNPS Workflow

In GNPS, we have brought Sirius in house to enable users to perform automated high throughput analysis with Sirius. There are three distinct operations we support for Sirius:

1. Formula Prediction
1. Structure Assignment
1. Compound Class Prediction
