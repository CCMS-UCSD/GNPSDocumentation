In this tutorial we highlight how to use Feature Based Molecular Networking (using MZMine2) to uncover unique metabolism of molecules found in the American Gut Project.

## Experimental Setup

LC-MS/MS analysis of American Gut Stool samples for participants that consumed plants.

## Learning Objectives

1. Learn how to download files from GNPS Datasets
2. Run MZmine2 feature detection and output quantification and MS/MS associated with each feature. [See the tutorial here](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/featurebasedmolecularnetworking/)
3. Run Feature Based Molecular Networking from MZMine2 in GNPS. [See the workflow here](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/index.jsp?params=%7B%22workflow%22:%22METABOLOMICS-SNETS-MZMINE%22,%22library_on_server%22:%22d.speclibs;%22%7D) (Note that you must be logged in GNPS first).


## Required Software Installs

1. FTP Client (e.g. WinSCP, DO NOT FileZilla!) [See instructions here](http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/service/massive/documentation/submit-data/upload-data/)
2. [MZMine2](https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine2/releases) for feature detection
3. [Cytocape](http://www.cytoscape.org/download.php) for network visualization

## Data Availability

LC-MS/MS data can be found in the [MassIVE dataset MSV000082678](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=de2d18fd91804785bce8c225cc94a444).
