In this tutorial we highlight how to use MZmine2 to detect features to produce files for Feature Based Molecular Networking to uncover unique metabolism of molecules found in the American Gut Project.

## Experimental Setup

LC-MS/MS analysis of American Gut Stool samples for participants that consumed plants.

## Learning Objectives

1. Learn how to download files from GNPS Datasets
2. Run MZmine2 feature detection and output quantification and MS/MS associated with each feature. [See the tutorial here](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/featurebasedmolecularnetworking/)


## Required Software Installs

1. FTP Client (e.g. WinSCP, DO NOT FileZilla!) [See instructions here](http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/service/massive/documentation/submit-data/upload-data/)
2. [MZMine2](https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine2/releases) for feature detection
3. [Cytocape](http://www.cytoscape.org/download.php) for network visualization

## Data Availability

LC-MS/MS data can be found in the [MassIVE dataset MSV000082678](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=de2d18fd91804785bce8c225cc94a444).
