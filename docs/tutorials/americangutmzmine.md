In this tutorial we highlight how to use Feature Based Molecular Networking (using MZMine2) to uncover unique metabolism of molecules found in the American Gut Project.

## Experimental Setup

LC/MS/MS analysis of American Gut Stool samples for participants that consumed plants.

## Learning Objectives

1. Learn how to download files from GNPS Datasets
2. Run MZMine2 feature detection and output quantification and MS/MS associated with each feature
3. Run Feature Based Molecular Networking from MZMine2 in GNPS - Under Construction

## Required Software Installs

1. FTP Client (e.g. WinSCP, NOT FileZilla)
2. [MZMine2](https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine2/releases) for feature detection
3. [Cytocape](http://www.cytoscape.org/download.php) for network visualization

## Data Availability

LC/MS/MS data can be found in the [MassIVE dataset MSV000082678](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=de2d18fd91804785bce8c225cc94a444).
