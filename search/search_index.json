This approach groups sets of spectra from related molecules (known as molecular families) even when the spectra themselves are not identified (do not match to any known compounds).\n\n\nMolecular networks in GNPS represents each spectrum as a node, and spectrum-to-spectrum alignments as edges (similar fragmentation implying similar structure) between nodes. Nodes can be supplemented with metadata, including library matches matches or information that is provided by the user, e.g. abundance, origin of product, hydrophobicity, etc. These metadata attributes can be reflected in a node\u2019s size or color.\n\n\nSpectral Library Search\n\n\nMS/MS data is searched against reference GNPS spectral libraries in a high throughput manner, scaling up to hundreds of files at a time. The spectral library search can be configured to either match exactly to known molecules or utilize variable dereplication to identify putative analogs of known compounds.\n\n\nSingle Spectrum Search\n\n\nQuery a single MS/MS spectrum across all public GNPS datasets. The mass spectrometry equivalent of NCBI BLAST helps to put the query spectrum in context of where else it occurs as well as search a single MS/MS spectrum against all public spectral libraries.\n\n\nAdvanced Analysis Tools\n\n\nDereplicator\n\n\nThe Insilico Peptidic Natural Products Dereplicator is a bioinformatic tool that allows the annotation of known peptidic natural products in MS/MS data using in silico fragmentation tree.\n\n\nNetwork Annotation Propogation\n\n\nNetwork Annotation Propagation (NAP) uses spectral networks to propagate information from spectral library matching, in order to improve in silico fragmentation candidate structure ranking.\n\n\nAnalysis Tools in Active Development\n\n\nFeature Based Molecular Networking\n\n\nFeature Based Molecular Networking relies on feature detection to determine molecule abundances and aligns these abundances across a cohort of samples into consensus features. Corresponding MS/MS spectra are assigned to each consensus feature and analyzed with spectral library search and molecular networking. This approach enables 1. more accurate quantification of molecules, 2. resolution of isomeric compounds, 3. reduction of redundancy of MS/MS molecules.\n\n\nThis work builds on the efforts of our many colleagues, please check out their work:\n\n\nMZmine 2 Data-Preprocessing To Enhance Molecular Networking Reliability.
