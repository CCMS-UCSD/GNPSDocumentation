Below are additional guidelines that describe the kinds of data that GNPS's analysis tools and shared knowledgebase handle.\n\n\nIonization Type\n\n\nGNPS supports data from soft ionization sources, e.g. electro spray ionization (ESI), Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI), Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI).\n\n\nFragmentation\n\n\nGNPS only accepts data dependent acquisition data (DDA), i.e. molecules were fragmented with collision induced dissociation (CID), Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD), or Electron-transfer dissociation (ETD). This produces tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) that can be identified via spectral library search and organized into families of molecules with molecular networking.\n\n\nData Sizes\n\n\nGNPS was designed to process MS/MS datasets of entire LC/MS runs. Many of the analysis tools were meant for datasets with at least hundreds of MS/MS spectra. While it is feasible to analyze a small amount of MS/MS spectra, certain capabilities (e.g. Molecular Networking) will not be effective at such small scales.\n\n\nFor extremely small datasets (e.g. single MS/MS spectra), we recommend utilizing our \nsingle spectrum search\n tool and not molecular networking.\n\n\nFor datasets that at least include an entire LC/MS run of MS/MS spectra, all workflows will accept. For molecular networking, please refer to the parameters and \npresets\n.\n\n\nFile Formats\n\n\nMass spectrometry files must be converted from proprietary vendor formats to open file formats.

This visualization approach can detect sets of spectra from related molecules (molecular networks), even when the spectra themselves are not matched to any known compounds.\n\n\nThe visualization of molecular networks in GNPS represents each spectrum as a node, and spectrum-to-spectrum alignments as edges (connections) between nodes. Nodes can be supplemented with metadata, including dereplication matches or information that is provided by the user, e.g. as abundance, origin of product, biochemical activity, or hydrophobicity, which can be reflected in a node\u2019s size or color. This map of all related molecules is visualized as a global molecular network.\n\n\nFor more information about Molecular Networking check out the \nGNPS publication\n from 2016.\n\n\nData Input Preparation\n\n\nThe follow data is can be put into molecular networking.\n\n\n\n\nMass Spectrometry data files (required)\n\n\nMetadata/Group Mapping (optional)\n\n\n`ili 3D mapping files (optional)\n\n\n\n\nMass Spectrometry data files\n\n\nMolecular networking supports mzXML, mzML, and mgf file formats. To convert your file to the appropriate formats, check out our \ndocumentation\n.\n\n\nMetadata\n\n\nThe metadata file describes the samples properties and allows more flexibility for data analysis and visualization. It is an alternative way to assign groups when selecting data input files within the workflow of GNPS.\n\n\nThe current version of molecular networking allows to use the metadata table as an input. Although it is possible to use the legacy group mapping and attribute mapping file, we strongly advise to prepare metadata table instead.\n\n\nFormat\n\n\nThe metadata table is a text file (Tab separated) that users must create these file themselves using a text editor (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Notepad++ for Windows, gedit for Linux, TextWrangler for Mac OS). Using Metadata table can greatly ease the visualization and analysis of data within Cytoscape. We strongly encourage you to prepare those in advance and to share it publicly with your MassIVE data.\n\n\nYou can download an example and edit it appropriately. Finally users will need to upload just as you would upload data input files and select it in the metadata table file upload selection. For a metadata table file template, you can use the following .txt file - \nRight-click, and Save link as\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe only required columns in the metadata is \"filename\". NOTE: capitalization matters.\n\n\nMetadata columns that will be considered by molecular networking must be prefixed by \"ATTRIBUTE_\".\n\n\nPlease ensure that the file is saved as a tab separated text file. Excel (xlsx), rich text (rtf) are not acceptable.\n\n\nPardon our dust as we are migrating this documentation, if we missed anything, please check out our \nLegacy Documentation\n.\n\n\n`ili 3D Mapping Files\n\n\nThe metadata can also be used to specify spatial coordinates for direct visualization of the data in \n'ili toolbox\n.
