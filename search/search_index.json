Traditionally, after manuscript publication, mass spectrometry datasets remain static and are never heard from again, silo'd in data cemeteries. GNPS' approach is different, we aim to Automatically make new discoveries within each dataset Aid future analyses by putting new data in the context of all previously existing datasets GNPS achieves the first goal by periodically reanalyzing each and every public dataset. With ever expanding reference spectral libraries, GNPS makes new identifications within datasets in an automatic fashion, recording this growth in identifications, and reports it back to the community. GNPS achieves the second goal by enabling users to \"BLAST\" MS/MS spectra against the entire GNPS set of datasets (see MASST Search ). Exploring Current Continuous Identifications On each dataset page (See datasets ) the list of all continuous identifcations is listed under the \"Continuous Identification\" section. This list of all analyses shows the growth of identifications over time as well as how the identifications changed over time. For example, the 3D molecular skin cartography dataset (See MSV000078556 ) grew from 94 (April 9, 2014) identifications in the initial continuous identification to 860 (June 1, 2018). Dataset Subscriptions Whenever new identifications are made in a dataset, subscribers are automatically notified via email. To be subscribed to a dataset of interest, click the subscribe button on the dataset page: Continuous Identification Ratings Help us improve Continuous Identification by rating the matches returned on the \"All Identifications Page\". For each identification made, please rate each match according to the following rubric Rating Description 4 stars correct match as context is right (i.e., molecule is known/expected to be in the sample) 3 stars compound class match \u2013 at least part of the structure makes sense to match 2 stars cannot tell \u2013 might be correct from the spectrum match and context but there is not enough information to tell 1 star incorrect: molecule does not make sense in this context Users will be able to both add their own rating, add a comment for their given rating, as well as view the average rating of the identification.

The introduction of DEREPLICATOR VarQuest made possible to search variants of known peptidic natural products on GNPS. The introduction of DEREPLICATOR+ (PLUS) improved the confidence in the annotation from the DEREPLICATOR, and expanded annotations to non-peptidic natural products on GNPS. These algorithms and software are developed in collaboration of Saint Petersburg State University (Russia), University of California San Diego (CA, USA) and Carnegie Mellon University (PA, USA). Manuscripts and Citations If you used DEREPLICATOR tools, please cite the corresponding manuscripts: DEREPLICATOR: Mohimani et al., Dereplication of Peptidic Natural Products Through Database Search of Mass Spectra, Nature Chemical Biology , 13, 30\u201337 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1038/nchembio.2219 .

Accessing the DEREPLICATOR tools on GNPS The DEREPLICATOR (VarQuest) , and DEREPLICATOR+ are available on GNPS on the in silico tools page . STEP 1: Go to GNPS Go to http://gnps.ucsd.edu , and create/login to your account. STEP 2: Access DEREPLICATOR Find the \"In Silico Tools\" box and click on \"Browse Tools\". Choose either DEREPLICATOR (VarQuest) or DEREPLICATOR+. STEP 3: SELECT YOUR FILES Select/Import a mass spectrometry file : The input format accepted are mzML/mzXML/MGF. Note that have the option to import an existing GNPS dataset (by clicking on \"Share Files\") or upload your own data (by clicking on \"Upload Files\"). See the corresponding GNPS documentation for FTP upload. After getting done with selecting files, click on Finish Selection. STEP 4: CONFIGURE Configure the parameters for the DEREPLICATOR job : Select a title for your job, and adjust parameters depending on your data and the mass spectrometer used. BASIC OPTIONS: -- Precursor Ion Mass Tolerance : This value specifies how much fragment ions can be shifted from their expected m/z values. Default value is \u00b1 0.02 Da for high-resolution instruments (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap) and \u00b1 0.5 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ). -- Fragment ion Mass Tolerance : This value specifies how much fragment ions can be shifted from their expected m/z values. Default value is \u00b1 0.02 Da for high-resolution instruments (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap) and \u00b1 0.5 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ). -- Search analog (VarQuest) [RECOMMENDED TO USE]: The VarQuest algorithm can search for analogs of known natural products in MS/MS data using Dereplicator. VarQuest is a modification-tolerant database search tool that discovers unexpected modifications in a blind mode. Since the computational space for variable PNP identification is computationally expensive, VarQuest first constructs a set of feasible PSM using a simple scoring approach and further filters out this set using a rigorous scoring method. Using VarQuest will increase the job time. The use of VarQuest analogs option is recommended as it expands the search space, and it reduces the overall run time. ADVANCED OPTIONS: -- PNP database : a choice of two databases Regular/Extended (Extended one is more informative but 2 times larger, i.e. two times slower processing) -- Mimimum number of AA : Dereplicator is able to search for short peptides. This parameter determines what is the minimum number of amino acids, we consider for the compounds that are considered in Dereplicator search. -- Accurate P-values : accurate (but slow) algorithm for P-value computation (MS-DPR), by default raw estimation is used. -- Max charge : Maximum charge allowed. ADVANCED DEREPLICATOR OPTIONS: -- Max Isotopic Shift : When working with molecules with 1000 Da or higher masses, mass spectrometers commonly predict the precursor mass 1 or 2 Da higher than the monoisotopic mass due to the isotopic pattern. Setting Maximum isotopic shift to higher than 0 allows Dereplicator to consider these shifts in the precursor mass. -- Adducts : Dereplicator can search in addition to protonated adducts, sodiated and potassium adducts. ADVANCED VARQUEST OPTIONS: -- Max Allowed Modification Mass : Maximum difference allowed between the precursor ion of an unknown modified peptide and the (dereplicated) known peptide. -- Min Matched Peaks with Known Compound : Minimum number of common peaks between the MS/MS spectrum of an unknown modified peptide and the (dereplicated) known peptide. Select an email. Then click on submit. You will soon get an email with the link to the results when your job is finished. You can also check the status of your job in \"Jobs\" section. STEP 5: VIEW RESULTS See the DEREPLICATOR job status : The status of the job can be vizualized in your account job list, and through the link in provided in email you will received when the job is done. The job can be Cloned , for further parameters modifications. Summary Statistics and Workflow Parameters can be consulted on the respective links. Clic on View Unique Peptides (recommended), to have get the list of annotated molecules. Clic on the View All PSM (Peptide-Spectrum Match) to have detailed view of the peptides-to-spectrum matches. STEP 6: ANALYSE Explore the DEREPLICATOR annotations: Annotations can be sorted using various column (usually the score or the p-value), or a compound name can be searched with the filter function. Clic on Show Annotation to see the experimental spectrum and the matching with the fragmentation tree of the Dereplicator database. The experimental MS/MS spectrum can be viewed in the left panel. The blue peaks are fragment ions that matched the fragmentation tree of peptidic natural products in the database. The structure of the molecule is displayed on the right. In the Annotated fragments table, lists the ion fragments that matched with the fragmentation tree, along with their mass error, charge and intensities. Click on a blue peak to highlighted the corresponding fragment on the molecular structure, along with its properties. STEP 7: VALIDATE Validate a DEREPLICATOR annotation : More than 60% of Dereplicator annotations on GNPS Massive datasets (April 2016) were manually curated. Validating a DEREPLICATOR annotation (MSI level 1): A level 1 MSI identification can be achieved of the reference material is available for the compound, by ordering the compound and analyzing it with the same method LC-MS/MS. The MS/MS spectrum and retention time should be identical between the observed and reference MS/MS spectra (co-injection can be done to verify retention time). Annotation with the DEREPLICATOR (MSI level 2 or 3), one must: The MS/MS spectrum from the raw file must be inspected (consistency, noise level, ...) The adducts detected must be confirmed using the MS1 spectrum (mono-charged, di-charged ?, protonated adduct ?, ...). This can be done MZmine2. The molecular formula must be verified. Sirius can be used for that (only for single-charged compounds). Main fragment ions non-annotated by the DEREPLICATOR should be manually annotated. Look at the biological source(s) (species) for the peptidic natural product (Google scholar, Dictionnary of Natural Products, AntiMarin, MarinLit, ...), to see if it is consistent with the sample. If genome sequence(s) are available, genome mining can be performed to search potential biogenetic gene clusters. Mapping DEREPLICATOR results on molecular networks Run molecular networks with the spectral data (Files format can be mzML/mzXML/MGF). See the following documentation . Note that the Feature-Based Molecular Network workflow can run the DEREPLICATOR VarQuest automatically (with default parameters only). Download the molecular networks clustered data (.MGF file). Click on Download Clustered Spectra as MGF . Upload the .MGF file, and run a DEREPLICATOR job (see present documentation). Note that alternatively, the .MGF obtained with MZmine can be used (GNPS export module). When the job is completed click on View Unique Peptides . In the View unique Peptide page, download the .TSV annotation file. Click on download with Download button and unzip the file. Open the molecular networks with Cytoscape. See documentation here , and here for Feature-Based Molecular Networking In Cytoscape, import the .TSV table as attribute table. In Cytoscape go to File / Import / Table / File and select the .TSV annotation file for the dereplicator (see above). In the preview window, click on the Scan header to set the meaning to Key . Select/Unselect column as needed, and eventually change the name for table header if they are already in the molecular networks (otherwise, they will be replaced with the new table imported). Change the column header name from SMILES into SMILES_derepl Click on import. Now the attribute table is mapped into the networks. The structure can be viewed with the ChemViz2 plugin .

A: Data you upload to analyze at GNPS will remain private unless you explicitly make it public. The two ways to make your data public are to create MassIVE datasets that make entire datasets public or add individual annotated MS/MS spectra to GNPS spectral libraries. Q: Will MassIVE datasets that I create be public by default? A: No, when creating a MassIVE dataset, it is not public by default. On the input form page, you are able to set a password to access the MassIVE dataset. There is a Make Public link to make your dataset open to the public and documentation can be found here here. Such a feature is very useful because users can create a MassIVE dataset prior to publication submission that is private and password protected. The MassIVE dataset link can be provided to reviewers along with the password so to provide better transparency and increase probability of manuscript acceptance. Data Organization Q: How does the MassIVE data differ from the GNPS spectral libraries? A: MassIVE datasets consist of raw data. GNPS spectral libraries consist of spectra that have been individually assigned an identification. Q: Can I create my own private spectral libraries? A: Yes, but it is not recommended. Please contact administrators for further details. Spectral Libraries Q: How do I get access to the public spectral libraries? A: On the select input files popup, click on the shared files tab, and enter speclibs as an import share.

Genome Res, 13 (11), 2498-2504. doi:10.1101/gr.1239303 Downloading Cytoscape Files from GNPS The first step is to download the input file (.graphML file format) for import into Cytoscape. From the job status page in the Feature-Based Molecular Networking workflow, click on Download Cytoscape Data . Save and unzip the downloaded file. Unzip the file and the resulting folder will look like this: Import the molecular network in Cytoscape To import the network file into Cytoscape: * in Cytoscape click on Import Network from File System and then choose the .graphml file. * Alternatively, you can drag and drop the .graphml file into Cytoscape. The imported network will be displayed in the main window. In the Control Panel (left panel), in the Network tab, rename the network with right-click and select Rename Network . You can import the table file into Cytoscape. Click Import Table from File System , navigate to the \u201cDB_result\u201d folder and select the .csv file. Lastly, click OK in the opened window. Import supplementary annotations in Cytoscape Cytoscape allows to map additional annotations such as those produced by other workflows on GNPS. See the documentation for DEREPLICATOR , NAP , MS2LDA ., for more details. The FBMN workflow makes possible to map the annotations (molecular formula, cross collision section, etc) made by the processing software used for FBMN (MZmine, XCMS, MetaboScape, MS-DIAL, Progenesis QI), or other tool that processed the same .MGF/.MSP file. Regardless of the tool, the procedure follows these steps: Obtain the annotation table that needs to be mapped. This table must contain a column that contains the identifier that matches the name column in the network. This identifier corresponds to the SCANS or FEATURE_ID in the .MGF file. Verify that the identifier are indeed matching between the network and table. Import the table in Cytoscape. Go to Menu / Import / Import Table from File System . In the preview window, click on the header of the identifier column to set the meaning to Key (a key logo shows up) Import the table and map the annotation into the molecular network. [ IMPORTANT ] If columns already exist in the network, they will be replaced by the imported table ! Rename the header(s) of the imported table if necessary. Explore the annotation in the molecular network (see below). Rotation of the Network To rotate the entire molecular network choose the Layout tab and click Node Layout tool . In the opened window, uncheck the Selected Only box to rotate the entire network and move the blue bar to 90. You can also select specific subnetworks and rotate them by checking Selected only . Table Panel Visualization Data For advanced network visualisation and data analysis, you may click on Table Panel and select node or edge column information (network metadata) to be displayed. For example, in the Node Table , you can select the \"Compound_name\" (name of the spectral library match), the \" parent mass\" (precursor ion mass), the \" RTconsensus\" (retention time for the node), \" MZErrorPPM\" (ppm error with the spectral library match) and any attributes of interest in your in Node Table (node metadata). Create a New Style A style can be created by clicking on Create New Style and a style name can be specified (e.g. \"High vs Low Plant Consumer\"). The created style can be exported by going in the main menu to File > Export > Styles to File , or a previous style can be imported by clicking on Import > Style From File in the File menu. Edit the Style Node Styling Label In the Control Panel (left panel), go to the Style tab. Within the Node sub-tab, the properties of the node style can be modified. For example, you can choose the precursor mass as node label for the molecular networks [you need to select Passthrough Mapping as the Mapping Type ]. Go to Properties to display more style properties. Size In order to match the label size to the node size, go into Style panel , at Label Front Size option, select \u201c SumPeakIntensity \u201d or the \u201c number of spectra \u201d (as selected for node size) as Column and Continuous Mapping as Mapping Type . As described above, begin by setting the value for minimum and maximum node size value with the button Set Min and Max, then choose the same continuous mapping as used for the node size. Pie charts If you used a metadata table, the node table will contain group columns for each group specified in the metadata table. The group columns starts with \"_GNPSGROUP__\" and will consist of the mean (default and recommended) or summed intensity of the ion across the group's samples based on the MS1 feature table (LC-MS peak area). This group columns can be used to visualize groups as pie charts in the network. To start visualizing pie charts on node for the groups, click on the left box ( Def column) for the Image/Chart1 node property. Choose the Charts tab and select the Pie Chart Icon . Now, in the Data sub-tab, select the group columns you are interested in visualizing in the Select Columns box (e.g. \"GNPSGROUP: Less_than 5\" (low plant consumers) and \"GNPSGROUP:More_than_30\" (high plant consumers)). Click on Options (under Data ) to choose colors for the Groups (groups are numbered based on their position in the Selected Columns box). Click Apply when you are done with your selection. Edge Styling Width To aid in the visualization of individual node similarities within a cluster, the cosine score is displayed as an edge. The cosine scores define similarity between two MS/MS spectra. Scores ranging from 0 (totally dissimilar) to 1 (identical). The edge thickness can be used to visualize the cosine score value between related nodes. For this we will use the cosine-score-based continuous mapping for the edge thickness. Go to the Style tab, and the Edge sub-tab. From the Width property drop down menu, select \"cosine_score\" for the Column and Continuous Mapping for the Mapping Type . Double click on the Continuous Mapping area of the menu to adjust the thickness of the edge. Click OK to apply the setting changes. Optimise the minimum and maximum value for the continuous mapping. Mining information in the network Sub-network creation To separate one or multilple specific desired network(s), press \u201cctrl\u201d or \u201ccommand\u201d (windows or MacOS, respectively) at the same time drag the mouse to select the network(s). Then, click on the symbol as shown below. Automatically, the sub-network is created. For going back to the main network, go into the Control Panel , select Network and then choose the main network. The Toolbar function The Cytoscape's toolbar can be used to search nodes or edge metadata (e.g., \"shared name\" ). Note that this feature is very slow, especially with large networks. The list of nodes in the Note Table will be updated. You can select nodes of interest, perform right-click for Select nodes and then click on the + magnifier in the main menu to perform a zoom on the selected node. The Select function The Select function can be used to create a selection of nodes and/or edges based on their metadata and/or network topology. Go to the Control Panel and click on Select tab. Then, click on the \" + \" button and choose between column, degree, or topology filter(s) to add different filter properties. The \" x \" button deletes the corresponding property. For each filter property, various options are provided depending on the column type (numeric column: is , is not , between ; for string column: contains and does not contain . Here, we create annotation filter that selects nodes by the spectral library match with 10 ppm maximum error between precursor ions (\" MZErrorPPM \" from 0 to 10). By default, the filter should be automatically applied to the network, otherwise click Apply . Under the Filter tab, the number of nodes meeting the filter property variables (here 160 nodes) will be selected. These nodes are automatically selected and highlighted in yellow in the network. Filters are very powerful network analysis tools that can be modified, saved and exported. To rename, remove, create a new filter, or other options, click on the right button beside the Filter list menu. The list of available Filters will appear in the top part of the panel. For more details and options, follow this link . Bypass mode for style property A bypass could be applied to selected nodes and/or edged by going into the Style panel, and clicking on the Byp. column for the property you want to change such as Border paint and Border Width . For modifying or removing the bypass property, select the nodes of interest, click right and choose Remove Bypass or set Bypass option. Drawing structure in nodes The chemical structures can be visualized in the node using chemViz2 bioinformatics plugin for Cytoscape ( http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/cytoscape/chemViz/ ). First, the chemViz2 plugin has to be installed. To do that, go to the Apps tab in the main menu, then open App Manager . In the Install Apps tab click on chemViz2 and install it by clicking Install . For more information about chemViz2, refer to the information available on the chemViz2 website . Once installed, chemViz2 can be used to display chemical structures on nodes. First, you will have to verify that chemViz2 is properly parameterized. Select Apps in the main menu, go to Cheminformatics Tools and click Settings . In the Attribute Settings section, choose node.Smiles for SMILES Attribute and/or node.INCHI for InCHI Attribute . Apply it by clicking OK . Finally, to draw structures in the nodes, return to Apps > Cheminformatics Tools > Paint Structures and select on all nodes or on selected nodes . Visualize the results. If needed, create a dedicated style to facilitate structure visualization. Mapping other node information Cytoscape enables to map informations obtained from the other workflows/softwares. Visualize this annotation by creating novel styles and changing its properties. Video Tutorial FBMN and Cytoscape Our tutorial on running the FBMN analysis on GNPS including a Cytoscape demo .

Identifying metabolites by integrating metabolome databases with mass spectrometry cheminformatics. Nature Methods 15, 53-56 (2018). Mass Spectrometry Data Processing with MS-DIAL In MS-DIAL, a sequence of steps is performed to process the mass spectrometry data. Here we will present key steps required to process LC-MS/MS data acquired in non-targeted mode (data dependent acquisition). MS- DIAL can process LC-MS/MS data performed in non-targeted mode, but also in MSE and now with Ion Mobility Spectrometry. For convenience we also provide a batch file (XML format) that can be imported directly in MS-DIAL. IMPORTANT: MS-DIAL parameters will vary depending on the mass spectrometer, the acquisition parameters, and the samples studied. In this page we present a basic guideline for using MS-DIAL with the FBMN on GNPS. Documentation Please consult these resources for more details on MS-DIAL processing: See the MS-DIAL documentation on LC-MS/MS data processing See the MS-DIAL documentation for MSE data processing See the MS-DIAL documentation on Ion Mobility Spectrometry data processing Video Presentation and Tutorials The presentation/tutorial about MS-DIAL from the Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry. This video from the WCMC about MS-DIAL The video tutorial about MS-DIAL processing for FBMN on GNPS . Convert your LC-MS/MS Data to Open Format MS-DIAL accepts different input formats. Note that we recommend first to convert your files to mzML format before doing MS-DIAL processing. See the documentation here . Processing Steps for non-targeted LC-MS/MS Below is a walk-through of all the steps 1. Make a New Project Go to Menu: File / New Project Select appropriate parameters (ionization type / method type / data type / ion mode / target omics) for your dataset. Click \u201cNext\u201d. 2. Import Files Click \u201cbrowse\u201d and open the dropdown menu for file types, and select \u201cmzML file(*.mzml)\u201d. The other available options are .abf or .cdf files. [Note] Data files should be placed at the same folder with the project file. Select files and click \u201cOpen\u201d. You will see the list of selected files. Click \u201cNext\u201d. 3. Set Parameters - Data Collection Set the MS1/MS2 tolerance and data collection parameters. If you are dealing with a large dataset, you can reduce the running time by setting multithreading option in the \u201cAdvanced\u201d menu. 4. Set Parameters - Peak Detection Set the MS1 peak detection parameters. You should set a peak height threshold that is adapted to the mass spectrometer. As a rule of thumb, the value should at least correspond to the minimum value set for the triggering of the MS2 scan event. If you want to remove some specific ions (e.g. known contaminants), you can make an exclusion list here. 5. Set Parameters - MS2Deconvolution You should set an appropriate MS/MS abundance cutoff. Make sure to set an intensity threshold representative of the noise level in MS2 spectra. This is typically lower than for MS1. If you have any doubt, set it to 0. 6. Set Parameters - Alignment Set appropriate Retention time / MS1 tolerance for alignment. If you have any quality control (QC) sample data, it is a nice candidate to be the reference file. Click \u201cFinish\u201d, then MS-DIAL will perform all the feature detection and alignment process. Processing Steps for MSE data (Experimental) See the MS-DIAL documentation for MSE data processing , and export the files as indicated below. If you encounter any issue, please contact the GNPS team on the forum or GitHub . Ion Mobility Spectrometry data (Experimental) See the MS-DIAL documentation on Ion Mobility Spectrometry data processing , and export the files as indicated below. If you encounter any issue, please contact the GNPS team on the forum or GitHub . Export the files for GNPS FBMN To run FBMN after MS-DIAL processing, two files have to be exported: The feature quantification table (TXT file) containing compound intensity and annotation. The MS/MS spectral summary (MGF file) containing the list of representative MS/MS spectra (the most intense MS/MS spectrum). Go to Menu: Export / Alignment result Make sur the \u201cGNPS export\u201d box is checked, and set the spectra type to \u201ccentroid\u201d. Set the directory and file name, then click \u201cExport\u201d. As a result, you will acquire a MS/MS spectral summary and the feature quantification table. [Note] The GNPS export option of MS-DIAL will create a feature table based on MS1 peak height. If you want a feature table based on peak area, check the \u201cRaw data matrix (Area)\u201d. See example of files generated by MS-DIAL and used for the FBMN by the export workflow here . 3. Running the FBMN with MS-DIAL After the processing with MS-DIAL, the output files can be used to run the Feature-Based Molecular Networking workflow on GNPS either using the [Superquick FBMN start page] (http://dorresteinappshub.ucsd.edu:5050/featurebasednetworking) or the standard interface of the FBMN workflow (you need to be logged in GNPS first). See the main documentation for more details about the FBMN workflow on GNPS . Basically, you will need to upload the files produced by MS-DIAL: The feature quantification table (.TXT file) The MS/MS spetral summary file (.MGF file) (Optional) The metadata table - requirements are described here . IMPORTANT WHEN USING A METADATA TABLE WITH MS-DIAL : \"filename\" in the metadata files for FBMN with MS-DIAL should not contain file extensions (ex: \"sample1.mzML\" must be \"sample1\"). Here is an example MS-DIAL networking job from a subset of the American Gut Project. Tutorials See our MS-DIAL tutorial on using Feature Based Molecular Networking for the American Gut Project sample.

See our preprint on bioaRxiv . Below we describe how to use MZmine2 v2.51 with the FBMN workflow on GNPS. We have previously written the documentation for v2.33 and have noted differences in the software versions.

BMC Bioinformatics 11, 395 (2010). The development of the features used in the pipeline is publicly accessible here . Installation Download the latest version of MZmine software (version MZmine v2.33 minimum) at https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine2/releases . Data Processing with MZmine for FBMN In MZmine, a sequence of steps are performed to process the mass spectrometry data. Here we will present key steps required to process LC-MS/MS data acquired in non-targeted mode (data dependent acquisition). For convenience we also provide a batch file (XML format) that can be imported directly in MZmine. IMPORTANT: MZmine parameters will vary depending on the instrument used, the acquisition parameters, and samples studied. The following documentation serves a basic guideline for using MZmine with the FBMN workflow. Please consult the resources below for more details on MZmine processing: The official documentation http://mzmine.github.io/documentation.html , The MZmine tutorial by Pierre-Marie Allard and Joelle Houriet from the University of Geneva. The video tutorial below about MZmine2 processing for Feature Based Molecular Networking . Note that this video is slighlty outdatted , so please refer to the steps described in this documentation. The video tutorial below about Quick MZMine2 Export to GNPS for FBMN Convert your LC-MS/MS Data to an Open Format MZmine accepts different input formats. Note that we recommand to first convert your files to mzML format before doing MZmine2 processing. See the documentation here . Processing Steps Below is the schematic representation of the LC-MS/MS data processing steps with MZmine (thanks Daniel Petras !): Below is the overview of the LC-MS/MS data processing steps in the MZmine batch mode: Batch Import Here are some MZmine batch that are compatible with the FBMN workflow. These batch files can be imported into MZMine (Batch mode): Instrument Gradient Length Matrix Type Sample Size Download Bruker Maxis HD qTof 10 Min Stool 20 Batch Please contribute a send batch file for various instruments Batch Processing Steps Below is a walk-through of all the steps 1. Import Files Go to Menu: Raw data methods > Raw data import > Select the files 2. Mass Detection This step creates mass lists from your raw LC-MS/MS data (non-targeted mode). Perform mass detection on MS level 1: Menu: Raw data methods > Feature Detection > Mass detection > Set filters: MS level 1. (version 2.33) Menu: Raw data methods > Mass detection > Set filter : MS level 1 IMPORTANT Set an appropriate intensity threshold. You can use the preview window to assess the right threshold on your data. As a rule of thumb, the value should at least correspond to the minimum value set for the triggering of the MS2 scan event. (Example: MAXIS-QTOF: 1E3, Q-Exactive 1E4) Perform mass detection on MS level 2. The same mass list name must be used. Go to Menu: Raw data methods > Feature Detection > Mass detection > Set filters: MS level 2. (version 2.33) Go to: Raw data methods > Mass detection > Set filter : MS level 2. IMPORTANT: Make sure to set an intensity threshold representative of noise level in the MS2 spectra. This is typically lower than for MS1. (Example: maXis QTOF: 1E2; LTQ-XL Orbitrap 1E4, Q-Exactive: 0). If you have any doubt, set it to 0. 3. Build Chromatogram (LC-MS feature detection part 1) Starting with MZmine 2.39, the original Chromatogram builder is considered deprecated. It has been replaced with the ADAP Chromatogram Builder. The ADAP Module includes parameters for the Min group size # of scans and Group intensity threshold. Further explanation for these parameters can be found in the ADAP Tutorial . If you use the ADAP Chromatogram Builder, please cite the publication below. Myers, O.D. et al, One Step Forward for Reducing False Positive and False Negative Compound Identifications from Mass Spectrometry Metabolomics Data: New Algorithms for Constructing Extracted Ion Chromatograms and Detecting Chromatographic Peaks . Anal. Chem. 89, 17, 8696-8703 (2017). Go to: Raw data methods > Feature Detection > Chromatogram builder OR ADAP Chromatogram builder (version 2.33) Go to: Raw data methods > Chromatogram builder 4. Deconvolve the Chromatogram (LC-MS feature detection part 2) Go to Menu: Feature list methods > Feature detection > Chromatogram deconvolution (version 2.33) Go to Menu: Peak list methods > Peak detection > Chromatogram deconvolution IMPORTANT: tick both options \"m/z range for MS2 scan pairing (Da)\" and \"RT range for MS2 scan pairing (min)\". The values have to be defined according to your experimental setup (expected MS mass accuracy and chromatographic peak width). Example for a UHPLC colum (1.7 \u00b5m C18, 50 \u00d7 2.1 mm, flow rate of 0.5 mL/min): maXis-QTOF: 12 min gradient, 0.02 Da and 0.15 min Q-Exactive: 5 min gradient, 0.01 Da and 0.1 min 5. Group isotopes and co-eluting ions Use the \"Isotopic peaks grouper\" [recommended] or other alternative (such as the CAMERA module). Go to Menu: Feature list methods > Isotopes > Isotopic peaks grouper (version 2.33) Go to Menu: Peak list methods > Isotopes > Isotopic peaks grouper. IMPORTANT: This depends on your expected peak shapes, duty cycle time and the MS mass accuracy. (Example: MAXIS-QTOF, 10 min gradient, 0.1 min, 0.02 m/z; Q-Exactive, 5 min gradient, 0.05 min, 0.01 m/z) 6. Order the peaklists Go to Menu: Peak list methods > Order peak lists . IMPORTANT: This is to ensure the reproducibility of the processing. Indeed, the aligned peak list will change slighlty if that step is not performed. 7. LC-MS feature alignement (Peaklist alignement) In this step, the peak lists from each sample will be aligned in one aligned peak list. The alignement is performed iteratively using the first peak list selected (see MZmine documentation). For that reason, make sure the first sample is adapted (not a negative control) or to manually put an representative peaklist in the first position. Go to Menu: Feature list methods > Alignment > Join aligner (version 2.33) Go to Menu: Peak list methods > Alignment > Join aligner 8. (Optional) Detect Missing Peaks / Gap Filling Gap filling enables to retrieve the intensity of a peak in all the samples, even if it was not detected in a previous processing step. Go to Menu: Feature list methods > Gap filling > Peak finder (multi-threaded) . (version 2.33) Go to Menu: Peak list methods > Gap filling > Peak finder (multi-threaded) . IMPORTANT: This step is optional. Use the multi-threaded peak finder for fast processing. 9. (Optional) Filter the Peaklist to MS/MS Peaks Depending on the number of features in the aligned peaklist, it is possible to filter the peaklist to keep only features with minimum number of occurences (\"Minimum peaks in a row\") or a mininum number of isotopic peaks for the feature (\"Minimum peaks in an isotope pattern\"), or to \"Keep only peaks with MS2 scan (GNPS)\". Go to Menu: Feature list methods > Filtering > Feature list rows filter > Select the filters (version 2.33) Go to Menu: Peak list methods > Filtering > Peak list row filter > Select the filters IMPORTANT: if you use a filter, we recommend using the filter \"Reset the peak number ID\" IMPORTANT Note that this step was mandatory in the prototype versions of FBMN with MZmine, now the filter \"Keep only peaks with MS2 scan (GNPS)\" is optional. 10. Use the GNPS Export module Use the dedicated module \" Submit to/Export for GNPS \" in MZmine under Feature list methods > Export/Import to export the needed file: the feature quantification table (.CSV file format) with LC-MS feature intensities. the MS/MS spectral summary (.MGF file), with a representative MS/MS spectrum per LC-MS feature. The MS/MS spectrum correspond either to the most intense MS/MS found for the feature, or to the merged spectrum (new feature !) Select the lastest \"filtered aligned peaklist\" generated and Go to Menu: Peak list methods > Export > Export for/Submit to GNPS See an example of files generated by the export module using the workflow: here . The files can be uploaded to the GNPS web-platform and Feature-Based Molecular Networking job can be directly launched IMPORTANT: While the possibility to submit the files directly to GNPS and launch a FBMN job on the fly is really convenient for quick data analysis, the files will not be saved in your personal account on GNPS and are periodically deleted, which will prevent futur cloning of the jobs. If you do not provide username/password, and you are limited to basic presets of parameters. For that reason, we recommend to upload your files with the FTP uploader (see documentation) and prepare your job directly on GNPS (you must be logged in first). In the \" Export for/Submit to GNPS \" module, select the option: \" Submit to GNPS \" [Optional] Metadata file: specify the path to the metadata table in GNPS format. See documentation here Select the parameters presets for the GNPS job. [Optional] Email: specify the email to forward the job link [Optional] Annotation edges (Experimental feature that will described later). [Optional] Open website: if ticked, will open the job webpage. ADDITIONAL NOTES: The feature table must contain at least the row ID, the row m/z, and row retention time, along with the sample columns. It is currently mandatory for the sample name headers to have the following format: \"filename Peak area\". Depending on the steps used in MZmine the sample name header can be \"filename baseline-corrected Peak area\", but this has to be changed back to \"filename Peak area\".

The code for the Open-GNPS pipeline (ProteoSAFe workflow and python wrapper) is available on this GitHub repository . Feature Detection with OpenMS for the FBMN We have developed an OpenMS-GNPS pipeline that can be used for the processing of metabolomics LC-MS data with OpenMS and Feature Based Molecular Networking (FBMN). This pipeline uses OpenMS tools and the GNPSExport (part of OpenMS TOPP tools). In brief, after running an OpenMS \"metabolomics\" pipeline , the GNPSExport TOPP tool can be used on the consensusXML file and corresponding mzML files to generate the files needed for FBMN on GNPS. These two files are: The feature quantification table (.TXT format) which is generated with the TextExport tool. The MS2 spectral summary file (.MGF format) which is generated with the GNPSExport tool. Running the OpenMS-GNPS pipeline on GNPS web-platform The OpenMS-GNPS pipeline is an experimetal workflow deployed currently on proteomics2.ucsd.edu [https://proteomics2.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/]). The job can be configured as follows: Connect to https://proteomics2.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/ (You will have to be logged in to proteomics2.ucsd.edu first). Select the workflow: OpenMS + GNPS workflow In Import Data Files, select the input mzML files (prefered) or mzXML files (not recommended, because the pipeline would have to perform conversion to mzML) [TO BE RELEASED] Select the parameters from the presets HPLC-Q-Exactive, UHPLC-Q-Exactive, HPLC-QTOF, UHPLC-Q-Exactive . The corresponding OpenMS configuration files (.INI files) are available from that [GitHub repository] (https://github.com/Bioinformatic-squad-DorresteinLab/openms-gnps-workflow/presets/)). Alternatively, you can upload your OpenMS TOPP tool parameter file (.INI files). Note that parameter files can be updated with a text editor or with the INIFileEditor TOPP tool. Wait for the job to complete. You will get a notification. Download the main output files with \"Download OpenMS Output Files\" and/or all the files with \"Download Workflow Files\". Unzip the archive. Examine the consensusXML file (in the filefilter folder) with TOPPAS.

See documentation for the FBMN workflow on GNPS . Alternatively, upload these files via FTP for FBMN on GNPS , or use them for other annotation tools ( DEREPLICATOR , Mass2Motif , NAP . Running the OpenMS-GNPS pipeline with OpenMS TOPP tools Installation and requirement Installing OpenMS TOPP tools: See the OpenMS website at https://www.openms.de/ Representative OpenMS-GNPS workflow A representative OpenMS-GNPS workflow would sequencially use these OpenMS TOPP tools: Input the mzML files. Run the FeatureFinderMetabo tool on the mzML files. Run the IDMapper tool on the featureXML and mzML files. Run the MapAlignerPoseClustering tool on the featureXML files. Run the MetaboliteAdductDecharger tool on the featureXML files. Run the FeatureLinkerUnlabeledKD tool or FeatureLinkerUnlabeledQT , on the featureXML files and output a consensusXML file. Run the FileFilter tool on the consensusXML file to keep only consensusElements with at least MS/MS scan (peptide annotation). Run the GNPSExport tool on the \"filtered consensusXML file\" to export an .MGF file. Run the TextExport tool on the \"filtered consensusXML file\" to export a .TXT file. Upload your files to GNPS and run the Feature-Based Molecular Networking workflow. See the main documentation for using FBMN on GNPS . Requirements for the OpenMS-GNPS pipeline The IDMapper has to be run on the featureXML files, in order to associate MS2 scan(s) (peptide annotation) with each feature. These peptide annotations are used by the GNPSExport. The FileFilter has to be run on the consensusXML file, prior to the GNPSExport, in order to remove consensusElements without MS2 scans (peptide annotation). The GNPSExport TOPP tool The GNPSExport TOPP tool can be run on the consensusXML file and corresponding mzML files to generate a MS/MS spectral file (MGF format) and corresponding feature quantification table (.TXT format) that contains LC-MS peak area intensities. For each consensusElement in the consensusXML file, GNPSExport produces one representative consensus MS/MS spectrum (named peptide annotation in OpenMS jargon) saved to the MS/MS spectral summary file (.MGF file). Several modes for the generation of the consensus MS/MS spectrum are available and described below. Note that these parameters are defined in the GNPSExport parameters file (.INI file, available with that link ).

Eligible MS/MS scans have a pairwise cosine similarity with the MS/MS scan of highest precursor intensity above the Cosine Similarity Treshold . The fragment ions of merged MS/MS scans are binned in m/z (or Da) range defined by the Binning width parameter. Cosine Similarity Treshold : merged_spectra:cos_similarity (float, default: 0.9) - Parameter that defines Cosine Similarity Treshold for the pairwise cosine similarity between the MS/MS scan with the highest precursor intensity and the other MS/MS scans. Binning width : merged_spectra:ms2_binned_size (float, default: 0.02 Daltons) - Parameter that defines the Binning width of fragment ions during the merging of eligible MS/MS spectra. Most intense : most_intense - For each consensusElement , the GNPSExport will output the most intense MS/MS scan (with the highest precursor ion intensity) as consensus MS/MS spectrum . All MS/MS : full_spectra - For each consensusElement , the GNPSExport will output All MS/MS scans . Note that mass accuracy and the retention time window for the pairing between MS/MS scans and a LC-MS feature orconsensusElement is defined at the IDMapper tool step. Running the FBMN workflow with OpenMS files After the processing with OpenMS, the output files can be used to run the Feature-Based Molecular Networking workflow on GNPS either using the [Superquick FBMN start page] (http://dorresteinappshub.ucsd.edu:5050/featurebasednetworking) or the standard interface of the FBMN workflow (you need to be logged in GNPS first).

The FBMN Workflow in GNPS There is a dedicated Feature-Based Molecular Networking workflow on GNPS that can be accessed here (you need to be logged in GNPS first). Requirement for the FBMN workflow After processing your LC-MS/MS data with the prefered software, it is possible to export the results following two methods: Three type of input files are needed (test files for each software are accessible here ): Option A (RECOMMENDED) - Export the processing results using a feature table and an .MGF file: A feature table with the intensities of LC-MS ion features (TXT or CSV format). A MS/MS spectral summary file with a list of MS/MS spectra associated with the LC-MS ion features (.MGF File). (.MGF file format). [Optional] Metadata table - described here [Optional] \"Supplementary Pairs\" of additional edges - described here Option B - Export the processing results using an mzTab-M and mzML files: Export a single mzTab-M file from the processed data. See and cite this publication . Use the mzML file(s) associated with mzTab-M file. [Optional] Metadata table - described here SuperQuick Feature Based Molecular Networking Workflow A simplified interace for Super Quick web interace for FBMN is available here . Running the SuperQuick FBMN Indicate your email and your GNPS Credentials. Select the 'Feature Generation tool'. Select the parameters preset. Option A. Drag and drop your \"feature quantification table\" and \"MS/MS spectral file\" (.MGF). See the respective documentation for FBMN each tool. Optional. Drag and drop a metadata table . Optional. Drag and drop a \"Supplementary Pairs\" csv file ( see format ) with additional edges Click on \"Analyze Uploaded Files with GNPS Molecular Networking\". While this SuperQuick FBMN interface is convenient for quick analysis, we recommend using the standard FBMN workflow. [ IMPORTANT ] The file uploaded along with the jobs submitted with Superquick start interface are deleted on monthly basis. Use the \"standard\" interface of the FBMN for persistant jobs and more options. Overview of the standard interface Select the file source Molecular Networks Options Basic Options Parameter Description Default Precursor Ion Mass Tolerance (PIMT) Parameter used for MS-Cluster and spectral library search expressed in Daltons. This value influences the aforementioned clustering of nearly-identical MS/MS spectra via MS-Cluster. Note that the value of this parameters should be consistent with the capabilities of the mass spectrometer and the specific instrument method used to generated the MS/MS data. Recommended Values value is \u00b1 0.02 Da for high-resolution instruments (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap) and \u00b1 2.0 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ). 0.02 Fragment Ion Mass Tolerance (FIMT) Parameters used for MS-Cluster, molecular networking, and MS/MS spectral library searches. For every group of MS/MS spectra being considered for clustering (consensus spectrum creation), this value specifies how much fragment ions can be shifted from their expected m/z values. Recommended Values value is \u00b1 0.02 Da for high-resolution instruments (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap) and \u00b1 0.5 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ). 0.02 Advanced Molecular Network Options Parameter Description Default Notes Min Pairs Cos Minimum cosine score for a pair of consensus MS/MS spectra in order for an edge to be formed in the molecular network 0.7 Lower value will increase the size of the clusters by inducing the clustering of less related MS/MS spectra, higher value will do the opposite. Minimum Matched Fragment Ion (Min Matched Peaks) Parameters used for molecular networking. The minimum number of common fragment ions that are shared by two separate consensus MS/MS spectra in order to be connected by an edge in the molecular network 6 A low value will permit linkages between spectra of molecules with few similar fragment ions, but it will result in many more less-related spectra being connected to the network. An higher value will do the opposite. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be adjusted depending on the experimental conditions for mass spectra acquisition (such as mode of ionisation, fragmentation conditions, the mobile phase, etc.), and the collision-induced fragmentation settings of the molecules of interest within the samples. High molecular weight (MW) compounds and compounds with more hetero-atoms generally tend to produce more fragment ions. However, this rule cannot is not absolute. For example, some lipids with high MW generate only a few fragment ions. Maximum shift between precursors The maximum m/z difference between two precursors permitting their spectra to be considered as direct neighbors in a molecular network 500 The maximum mass difference between two connected nodes in a molecular network. Network TopK Maximum number of neighbor nodes for one single node 10 The edge between two nodes are kept only if both nodes are within each other's \u2018TopK\u2019 most similar nodes. For example, if this value is set at 20, then a single node may be connected to up to 20 other nodes. Keeping this value low makes very large networks (many nodes) much easier to visualize. Maximum Connected Component Size Maximum number of nodes allowed in a single connected network 100 Nodes within a single connected molecular network will be separated by increasing cosine threshold for that specific connected molecular network. Default value is 100. Use 0 to allow an unlimited number of nodes in a single network. Note that with large datasets, or when a great number of related molecules are in the dataset, this value should be higher (or turn to 0) to retain as much information as possible. Downstream, these larger networks can be visualized using Cytoscape layout algorithms that can increase the intra-network clustering, allowing to visualize spectral groups in the network despite the number of nodes in the network. Advanced Spectral Library Search Options Parameter Description Default Library Search Min Matched Peaks Minimum number of common fragment ions that MS/MS spectra should contain in order to be considered for spectral library annotation. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be tuned depending on the molecules of interest, and the experimental conditions (such as the ionisation mode and the fragmentation conditions). For example, the collision-induced fragmentation of some lipids produce only a few fragment ions. A lower value will allow clustering of MS/MS spectra containing less fragment ions, however it will also induce clustering of MS/MS spectra from different molecular types to be connected in one network. A higher value will do the opposite 6 Score Threshold Minimum cosine score that MS/MS spectra should get in spectral matching with MS/MS spectral libraries in order to be considered an annotation. 0.7 Search Analogs Whether to search data for analogs to library spectra Don't Search Maximum Analog Search Mass Difference Maximum mass shift between the library and putative analogs found 100 (Da) Top results to report per query Number of matches to report for each feature 1 Advanced Filtering Options (for Spectra) Parameter Description Default Minimum Peak Intensity All fragment ions in the MS/MS spectra below this raw intensity value will be deleted. By default, the filtering is disabled. 0 Filter Precursor Window All peaks in a +/- 17 Da around precursor ion mass are deleted. Enabled by default. This removes the residual precursor ion, which is frequently observed in MS/MS spectra acquired on qTOFs. Filter Filter library Apply peak filters to library Filter Filter peaks in 50Da Window Filter out peaks that are not in the top 6 most intense peaks in a +/- 50Da window Filter Advanced quantification options There are additional normalization options specifically for the FBMN workflow: Parameter Description Default Normalization Per File Total Ion Current (TIC) normalization can be applied to the ion intensities (LC-MS1 peak area) per sample (NOT RECOMMENDED AS DEFAULT) No Norm Aggregation Method for Peak Abundances Per Group The ion feature intensity (LC-MS1 peak area) can be aggregated by GROUPS from the metadatable with either a Sum or Average (RECOMMENDED, because it is more robust to the difference in the number of samples per GROUPS). Average Advanced Extras \"Supplementary Pairs\" is an option to add extra edges to the resulting feature-based molecular network. It was initially implemented for the Ion Identity Networking (IIN) workflow. However, this approach is designed to stimulate the development and testing of new workflows as the input is an edge file in a generic csv format. An edge is described by the following table: Header Description ID1 Node ID 1 matching the row IDs ID2 Node ID 2 matching the row IDs EdgeType Any string describing the type of edge Score A numerical value for the score (cannot be empty) Annotation A string annotation Example of the Supplementary Pairs used in the Ion Identity Networking (IIN) workflow Inspecting the Results of FBMN on GNPS After the completion of the FBMN job (this will take from 10 to 10 hours depending on your number of samples and instrument), you will receive an email notification with a link to the results page (see example below). Spectral Library Match and Network Topology Analysis For more information about the inspection of the molecular networking results, please refer to the main documentation page . Web-browser Molecular Network Visualization Here is an example of web-browser view of molecular networks. Click on the link to view the interactive molecular networks . Inspecting the Results of FBMN in Cytoscape Cytoscape is an open source software platform used to visualize, analyze and annotate molecular networks from GNPS. See the documentation here . Demo GNPS job of FBMN Here is an example FBMN job with files resulting from MZmine2 processing of a subset of the [American Gut Project] (http://humanfoodproject.com/americangut/). Running the DEREPLICATOR The Insilico Peptidic Natural Products Dereplicator is a bioinformatic tool that allows the annotation of known peptidic natural products in MS/MS data using in silico fragmentation tree. This workflow is also included into the Feature Based Molecular Network workflow, then you have the option to use it by clicking into Advanced External tools. After your job has completed you can explore your results and even clone the Dereplicator job and modify the parameters. If you use that tool, please cite the DEREPLICATOR papers. See citations in the main DEREPLICATOR documentation . Running Network Annotation Propagation It is possible to use the results of FBMN to run Network Annotation Propagation (NAP). NAP uses spectral networks to propagate information from spectral library matching, in order to improve in silico fragmentation candidate structure ranking. See the following documentation for NAP If you use that tool, please cite the NAP paper. See citations in the main NAP documentation . Running MS2LDA Substructure Discovery The results of FBMN can be directly analyzed with MS2LDA . For this, on the result page click on \"Advanced View\" > \"Analyze with MS2LDA\". See the MS2LDA documentation . MS2LDA is a tool that decomposes molecular fragmentation data derived from large metabolomics experiments into annotated Mass2Motifs or discovers Mass2Motifs from experimental data. Mass2Motifs are fragmentation patterns of often co-occurring mass fragment peaks and/or neutral losses that often represent molecular substructures. Check out the MS2LDA website here where you can find more information, browse through data sets, and sign up for an account to run the Mass2Motif discovery on your own data. At GNPS, we are working with the MS2LDA team to integrate both workflows which allows users to map Mass2Motif occurrences in their Molecular Families. If you use that tool, please cite MS2LDA papers.

Development Source code The FBMN source code can be found on the GNPS_Workflows GitHub repository . Input files requirements Feature quantification table The feature quantification table (.TXT or CSV file) needs to have unique Feature IDentifier (integer) for each LC-MS1 feature that must match the \"SCANS=\" header of the corresponding spectrum in the MS/MS spectral summary (.MGF file). Note that the number of LC-MS1 features in the feature quantification table can be larger than the number of LC-MS1 features with a spectrum in the MS/MS spectral file . And the Feature IDentifier does not have to be sequencial. As a result, the feature quantification table can contain LC-MS1 feature that doesn't have an associated MS/MS scan in the MS/MS spectral file . The PCoA generated with qiime2 EMPeror uses the entire content of feature quantification table provided. MS/MS spectral summary The format of the feature quantification table should be consistent with the representative feature quantification tables defined for each processing tool. See this page for example files . Note that internally, the feature quantification table file inputted by the user are converted to a standard internal format prior to FBMN analysis in GNPS. The python scripts used for the conversion feature quantification Table from various software are available here . If you want to add support for another LC-MS processing tool, please contact us. Support for mz-Tab-M format The mzTab-M format is a standardized output designed for the report of metabolomics MS-data processing results. The FBMN workflow now supports the mzTab-M format (2.0, release 1.0.5). The mzTab-M file has to be inputed along with the related mzML files. Basically, the mzTab-M is used to retrieve for each LC-MS/MS feature: The abundance of the LC-MS/MS feature in each sample. The filename ( mzML ) and index of the associated MS/MS spectrum.

Table: Parameters for Library Search Search Options Fillable Field Definition Recommended User Input Spectrum Files Selection of files needed to analyze. The deconvoluted files usually are directly included into the Library search/Networking job. Allowed file formats are .mzML or .CDF. FORCE_EXACT_MATCH Keep default value of 1. Precursor Ion Mass Tolerance Maximum mass deviation between the observed precursor ion and the ions selected within the libraries included in the search. The choice of the precursor mass tolerance setting usually is influenced directly by the accuracy of the mass analyzer being used to measure the precursor spectra in LC-MS analysis, but modification of this parameter are not meaningful for EI data because there is no precursor ion. 20000 is the default value to encompass all ions. Min Matched Peaks Minimum number of common fragment ions that should share a spectra to be considered as a spectral library annotation. Default value is 6, but note that this parameter should be tuned depending on the molecules of interest and experimental conditions. It is recommended to perform several jobs modifying this parameter for testing possible outcomes variations in annotations. Typically high quality features contain more than 15 ions in EI data. Fragment Ion Mass Tolerance Maximum mass deviation between the observed fragments and the ions selected within the libraries included in the search. The choice of the precursor mass tolerance setting is influenced directly by the accuracy of the mass analyzer being used to measure the precursor spectra. Default value is \u00b1 0.025 Da for high-resolution mass spectrometers (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap). For low-resolution MS/MS instruments (e.g. , ion traps, triple-quadrupole/QqQ), a PIMT ion mass tolerance of \u00b1 2.0 Da is recommended. Note that this parameters should be tuned depending on data. Score Threshold Minimum cosine score to be considered as an annotation in spectral library search. 0.85 value is set as default. This value has been determined to effectively delineate subclasses and Levels 6 and 7 and usually performs well with data obtained through experiments without derivatization, but that will depend on the quality of the mass spectra obtained. For derivatized compounds the cosine value for good matches is generally lower by ~0.1 due to an inferior quality of the EI spectra. Advanced Search Options Fillable Field Definition Recommended User Input Library Class The level of library to include hits from. Keep default of \u201cBronze\u201d to include all possible hits from libraries. Top Hits Per Spectrum How many top hits ranked by the cosine score to be included into the results. The default of 1. It is recommended to keep this number relatively high (for example, 10 to include top 10 matches) to allow for correct annotation selection if it is not a top hit. Spectral Library Selection of spectral libraries to include in the search. Select all appropriate EI libraries by selecting them and clicking \u201cLibrary Files\u201d. Click \u201cFinish Selection\u201d when completed. Any of the user\u2019s own libraries could be included into the search as long as they are converted into .mgf format. If the libraries are curated and could be shared with the community, it is encouraged to upload them to GNPS as described here . Users have access to open and public libraries uploaded to GNPS, these can be selected at: CCMS_SpectralLibraries -> GNPS_GC_Libraries. Search Analogs Used for tandem MS data. Keep default of \u201cDon\u2019t Search\u201d. This option is used for LC-MS data. Maximum Analog Search Mass Difference Used for tandem MS data. Disabled when above option is set at \u201cDon\u2019t Search\u201d. Advanced Filtering Options Fillable Field Definition Recommended User Input Filter StdDev Intensity Used for tandem MS data. It is highly recommended to use a default value of 0 so that no filter is applied. Filter precursor window Used for tandem MS data. \u201cDon\u2019t Filter\u201d is set as default for the EI data because there is no precursor ion. Filter peaks in 50 Da window Removes peaks that are not one of the top 6 most intense within a +/- 50 Da window. Depending on the deconvolution results, this could be turned on or off: if fragmentation patterns contain a large number of small peaks, this filtering should be turned off, as it may filter out relevant peaks that could be signal. Filter SNR Intensity All ions with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the EI spectrum below this value raw intensity will be deleted. Use a default value of 0 so that no filter is applied, especially if the raw intensities of your data are very low. This value can be modified by the user for excluding background ions and just include the mass spectra of certain quality. Filter library Used for tandem MS data. Don\u2019t Filter is set as default for the EI data because there is no precursor ion. Min Peak Int All ions with a signal in the EI spectrum below this raw intensity will be deleted. Use a default value of 0 so that no filter is applied, especially if the raw intensities of your data are very low. Advanced Network Options Fillable Field Definition Recommended User Input Meta-table (Optional) Selection of metadata to include in the search. The metadata file describes the samples properties and allows more flexibility for data analysis and visualization. It is an alternative way to assign groups when selecting data input files within the workflow of GNPS, see an example here . Min pairs cos Minimum cosine score required for an edge to be formed between nodes. Lower value will increase the size of the clusters by inducing the clustering of less related spectra, higher value will limit do the opposite. 0.7 value is set as default. This value has been determined to effectively delineate subclasses and Levels 6 and 7 and usually performs well with data obtained through experiments without derivatization, but that will depend on the quality of the mass spectra obtained. For derivatized compounds the cosine value for good matches is generally lower due to an inferior quality of the EI spectra. Network TopK Pairs of nodes are reported only if they are found to be best matches in the topK in both directions that are above the minimum cosine score. Default is set to 10. This value enables the network to be more or less complex. Quant-table (Optional) Table including feature ID, retention time (in min.) with balance score, Rel. Max Integral and Sample\\Best order. The quantification table usually is directly included into the Library search/Networking job or can be imported externally. External deconvolution tools do not provide balance score and it will not be available in the search results. Maximum shift between precursors The maximum allowed difference in precursor m/z differences. Must be set to the higher m/z expected in the analysis for EI data since no precursor information is available (default value of 500) Maximum Connected Component Size Maximum number of nodes that can be connected in a single sub-network of a molecular network. This process iteratively breaks up large \u2018hairball\u2019 networks (of false positives) by removing the lowest scoring alignments (by cosine score) first until the resulting pieces fall below the maximum size. Default setting is 100 \u2013 this value can be set to 0 to allow for an unlimited number of nodes or a higher setting can be used for larger data sets or for data sets containing many structurally-related molecules. Low value encourages breaking up the \u201chairball\u201d clusters but increases the chance that some nodes become disconnected and fall out of the network. Advanced Kovats Index Calculation Options Fillable Field Definition Recommended User Input Perform Kovats Calculation Whether to perform calculation of Kovats retention index. If the user need to calculate Kovats RIs for the compounds during library search this parameter should be selected. (i) The Input Carbon Marker File could be provided for Kovats markers, but it must be conducted with identical protocol as the rest of the experiment. Input Carbon Marker File (Optional) If provided, this information will be used for retention index (RI_ estimation. The RI markers information should be submitted as a comma separated values (.csv) file in the following headers: Compound_Name - name of the compound (string), Carbon_Number - number of carbons (integer), RT - retention time in seconds (float). Example File . MSHub Balance Score The file that contains information for the balance score. The balance score is an estimation of mass spectrum patterns reproducibility across the entire dataset. This information is only available if deconvolution is conducted using MSHub and the file is appended automatically when launching library search job from completed MSHub deconvolution job. This file is optional and can be omitted when using deconvolution results from other deconvolution software. Advanced Deprecated Options These options are only relevant if/when the parent mass information is available and thus are strongly recommended to be left default. Inspect the Results After the job has been completed, the job status page gives access to several molecular networking results views: (i) \u201c View All Library Hits\u201d opens the interface that allows visualization of spectral matches to the reference database from selected libraries. It will display all of the top matches for each feature to different libraries and relevant information including retention time. The displayed columns could be edited by clicking the \u201cSelect columns\u201d link in the upper left corner. The possible annotations could be sorted by their cosine value to aid in selecting the best annotation using the researcher's judgment. The \u201cScan\u201d field corresponds to the feature number in the .mgf file generated at the feature detection step and corresponds to the \u201cNo\u201d field listed in the feature table. Clicking on the spectrum icon at the left side of the screen will show a mirror plot comparison between the query spectrum and the reference spectrum. This allows assessing the quality of matches between the deconvolution and the reference spectra. (ii) The \u201cView Top Hits\u201d option accesses the list of: top hits (Compound_Name) with the corresponding Scan (feature number), matched library class, cosine, number of shared peaks between library entry and the spectral pattern, abundance as TIC, retention time given in units used in input raw files, and information from the reference library entry, for all annotated spectra. (iii) The \"View All Spectra With Annotations\" option gives access to all annotated spectra with the same information listed. In addition, the balance score and Kovats RI values are also listed (if available) to allow including this information into making decisions for feature annotations. (vi) The link \u201cView Kovats Calculation Result\u201d shows Kovats calculation results for each spectrum if selected when launching the job. The displayed columns could be edited by clicking the \"Select columns\" link and selecting/deselecting columns as needed. NOTE : Clicking the \"Download\" link in ether view would allow downloading the results as a table will all the associated information for each library hit (including InChi, SMILES and CAS, whenever available); the file with the name \"MOLECULAR-LIBRARYSEARCH-GC*.tsv\" is in the root of the downloadable compressed folder. The button at the top of the page \u201cBack to status page\u201d allows going back. To visualize molecular networks generated, the user has to download the input network files from the \u201cDownload Cytoscape Data\u201d link, save the folder, and unzip it. In the job status page, some advanced views are available to visualized qiime2 emperor plots or bi-plots, and to download the associated tables. For more information, follow this link . Cloning a job If the same analysis needs to be repeated, it is possible to clone the job by clicking \u201cclone\u201d on the job status page. Cloning a job allows users to view all parameters and files that were used and rerun the job with the same, or adjusted parameters and files. Note that if data were imported from private user workspace and not from within MassIVE, other users will not have access to the data and consequently will not be able to rerun or reproduce the GNPS job. Sharing data The analysis conducted on GNPS as well as the deposited raw data could be shared as a hyperlink to the GNPS job(s) and the MassIVE accession number, correspondingly. GNPS stores data inputs and setting used for the analyses of the data, so the analysis could be shared and reproduced. See the documentation . Adding/Curating reference spectra High confidence spectra from experimental data or pure standards could be added as a reference spectrum to GNPS for future reference. See documentation . If the user wishes to upload >50 reference spectra to GNPS, a batch upload should be used to as detailed in the online help . The compliance of the file format can be verified using an online workflow. Visualization Network Visualization in Cytoscape The network can be visualized in an external software such as Cytoscape [1], an open-source software platform used to visualize, analyze, and annotate molecular networks from GNPS. Cytoscape is available for download from here . This software allowed to encode any property of the network (i.e. node shape or color, edge thickness) with a metadata category (i.e. cohort, cosine score, compound family). An online tutorial, created with Cytoscape 3.7, used for molecular networking generated with LC-MS/MS data, can be accessed here . Many of these steps could be reproduced in the same way for molecular networking from GC-MS data. [1] Shannon, P., et al. (2003). Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks. Genome Res, 13 (11), 2498-2504. doi:10.1101/gr.1239303 (A) Here we show an example of molecular networks visualizing in Cytoscape, generated from a study of volatiles related to aging of IPA beer ( GNPS link ). In Cytoscape, the different aging times (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 20 days) are represented by different colors, and the metabolites present in the beer (each node) can be mapped on the molecular networks. The size of each node represents the total abundance of the feature and the colors in the pie chart shows the proportions of the compound at different aging duration times (gradient from green to yellow to red). (B) Zoom in a cluster of terpenes annotated with compounds name is shown as an example. Networking can facilitate the interpretation of data by visualizing chemical changes. In this example, the annotated compounds E-nerolidol and alpha-limonene-diepoxide, framed in pink, appear to be present only in fresh beer (0 days) and disappear as the beer ages. (C) Other information can be mapped onto the network, for example, the same zoom with cosine values between nodes is shown instead of compound name annotations. NOTE : The name of the node corresponds to the best match of the spectral pattern to the library across the entire dataset. Consequently, for some nodes the top match is not selected as the node's name as there exists other spectral pattern in the data that has better match to the same compound in the library. In such cases, the next best matching annotation is used. Molecular mapping in ili Spatial distribution of different chemical features could be visualized in 2D or 3D using ili, a visualization app for 3D molecular cartography [2]. \u2018ili could be used either on the website or as a Chrome extension . For mapping, two files need to be uploaded (DRAG AND DROP): an image for 2D (PNG or JPG format) or model for 3D (STL format), and a .cvs file with the coordinates of the spots on the model that corresponds to the sampled locations. Examples of mapping applications are available on \u2018ili website . Here it is demonstrated how to map the volatile data on the same model as shown in the \u201cHuman skin metabolome\u201d example. [2] Protsyuk, I., et al. (2018). 3D molecular cartography using LC\u2013MS facilitated by Optimus and'ili software. Nature protocols , 13 (1), 134.https://doi.org/10.1038/nprot.2017.122 To create the .csv table, download the quantification table from GNPS deconvolution (example GNPS job ) output and add four columns with the x, y, z, and radius coordinates from the different sampling points as described [2]. For ease of navigation, the rows with feature descriptors could be deleted. The detailed instructions on creating the correctly formatted table with coordinates are given here . To create chemical maps, drag and drop the example volatilome table human 3D model. Different parameters can be set such as the spots, the mapping color, or the angles of visualization. To display different features, click on the feature identifier value listed above the color scale on the bottom right corner of the screen and select features to display. To annotate molecular features of interest, refer to the GNPS library search job for the matching features. Page contributors Alexander Aksenov (UCSD), Melissa Nothias-Esposito (UCSD), Mabel C.

Clicking on the spectrum icon at the left side of the screen will show a mirror plot comparison between the query spectrum and the reference spectrum. This allows assessing the quality of matches between the deconvolution and the reference spectra. (ii) The \u201cView Top Hits\u201d option accesses the list of: top hits (Compound_Name) with the corresponding Scan (feature number), matched library class, cosine, number of shared peaks between library entry and the spectral pattern, abundance as TIC, retention time given in units used in input raw files, and information from the reference library entry, for all annotated spectra. (iii) The \"View All Spectra With Annotations\" option gives access to all annotated spectra with the same information listed.

Cytoscape is available for download from here . This software allowed to encode any property of the network (i.e. node shape or color, edge thickness) with a metadata category (i.e. cohort, cosine score, compound family). An online tutorial, created with Cytoscape 3.7, used for molecular networking generated with LC-MS/MS data, can be accessed here . Many of these steps could be reproduced in the same way for molecular networking from GC-MS data. [1] Shannon, P., et al. (2003). Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks. Genome Res, 13 (11), 2498-2504. doi:10.1101/gr.1239303 (A) Here we show an example of molecular networks visualizing in Cytoscape, generated from a study of volatiles related to aging of IPA beer ( GNPS link ). In Cytoscape, the different aging times (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 20 days) are represented by different colors, and the metabolites present in the beer (each node) can be mapped on the molecular networks. The size of each node represents the total abundance of the feature and the colors in the pie chart shows the proportions of the compound at different aging duration times (gradient from green to yellow to red). (B) Zoom in a cluster of terpenes annotated with compounds name is shown as an example. Networking can facilitate the interpretation of data by visualizing chemical changes. In this example, the annotated compounds E-nerolidol and alpha-limonene-diepoxide, framed in pink, appear to be present only in fresh beer (0 days) and disappear as the beer ages. (C) Other information can be mapped onto the network, for example, the same zoom with cosine values between nodes is shown instead of compound name annotations. NOTE : The name of the node corresponds to the best match of the spectral pattern to the library across the entire dataset. Consequently, for some nodes the top match is not selected as the node's name as there exists other spectral pattern in the data that has better match to the same compound in the library. In such cases, the next best matching annotation is used.","title":"Network Visualization in Cytoscape"},{"location":"gc-ms-library-molecular-network/#molecular-mapping-in-ili","text":"Spatial distribution of different chemical features could be visualized in 2D or 3D using ili, a visualization app for 3D molecular cartography [2]. \u2018ili could be used either on the website or as a Chrome extension .

Below are additional guidelines that describe the kinds of data that GNPS's analysis tools and shared knowledgebase handle. Ionization Type GNPS supports data from soft ionization sources, e.g. electro spray ionization (ESI), Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI), Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). Fragmentation GNPS only accepts data dependent acquisition data (DDA), i.e. molecules were fragmented with collision induced dissociation (CID), Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD), or Electron-transfer dissociation (ETD). This produces tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) that can be identified via spectral library search and organized into families of molecules with molecular networking. Data Sizes GNPS was designed to process MS/MS datasets of entire LC/MS runs. Many of the analysis tools were meant for datasets with at least hundreds of MS/MS spectra. While it is feasible to analyze a small amount of MS/MS spectra, certain capabilities (e.g. Molecular Networking) will not be effective at such small scales.

Metadata adhering to the accepted formatting for each tool enhances data analysis and visualization options. We strongly encourage you to prepare metadata files in advance and upload to the supplementary file folder in the corresponding MassIVE dataset. Format The recommended starting point is the ReDU Sample Information Template (additional documentation can be found here ). Users can add an unlimited amount of additional columns to the ReDU Sample Information Template. There are specific instructions on required columns and formatting detailed for GNPS tools below. Metadata file used must be a tab-delimited text file. A .tsv can be downloaded from the ReDU Sample Information Template. Users that create a metadata file without using the ReDU Sample Information Template using a text editor (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Notepad++ for Windows, gedit for Linux, TextWrangler for Mac OS) should save as a .txt (tab-delimited). Note: Excel (xlsx), rich text (rtf) are not supported. Example metadata file without using the ReDU Sample Information Template Right-click, and Save link as to download. A text editor can be used to edit it as desired. Notes: The only required columns in the metadata is \"filename\" and the file names should match those uploaded to MassIVE. Capitalization matters. Requirements Specific to Molecular Networking The use of a metadata file is an alternative way to assign groups when selecting data input files within the workflow of GNPS.

Mass2Motifs are fragmentation patterns of often co-occurring mass fragment peaks and/or neutral losses that often represent molecular substructures. Check out the MS2LDA website here where you can find more information, browse through data sets, and sign up for an account to run the Mass2Motif discovery on your own data. At GNPS, we are working with the MS2LDA team to integrate both workflows which allows users to map Mass2Motif occurrences in their Molecular Families. It is now also possible to run MS2LDA analyses through the GNPS interface here which will lead to the below displayed job entry page. In this section, it is explained what input files are needed, how the parameters can be chosen, and what kind of output you get. Finally, it is explained how the obtained MS2LDA model can be further explored on the MS2LDA website by uploading the generated dict file. Collecting the Right Input Files After providing the GNPS analysis with a title, the right input files are needed to start an MS2LDA analysis. They can be obtained with the classical molecular network (MS-Cluster based, see documentation here ) or from the Feature-Based Molecular Networking workflow (using for example MZmine2, see documentation here . These files are: Required: Spectral data (MGF file) which can be downloaded from a processed Molecular Networking job Required: Edges file including selfloops which can be downloaded from a processed Molecular Networking job (i.e., typically found in the networkedges_selfloop folder within the downloaded GNPS job folder) Optional: MS1 peak abundance information (CSV file generated by MZmine2). The format must be similar to the MZmine2 format used with the Feature based Molecular Networking . This will allow you to perform MS1 differential analysis within the MS2LDA web app to find discriminate Mass2Motifs between groups. After selecting the input files, the right MGF Source needs to be selected: \"MSCluster\" for a classical Molecular Networking derived clustered MGF file, and \"MZmine2\" for a Feature based Molecular Networking derived MGF file. Quickstart from Processed Molecular Network To facilitate MS2LDA analysis of processed Molecular Networking jobs, in the newest (V2) version and the Feature Based Molecular Networking job, under \"Advanced Views - Experimental Views\" there is a button Analyze with MS2LDA that will bring you directly to the MS2LDA analysis page prefilling the relevant input files (spectral MGF file and edge pair file including selfloops). See also the animated GIF below. Please note that you can adapt the title and you must check the relevant MS2LDA parameter settings for your data set. Setting the MS2LDA Parameters There are three sections of parameters to fill out of which the first is the most important. Default values are provided for all settings, but each of them is dependent on the input data. We provide some guidelines here to ease your choice. LDA Parameters The \"Advanced MS2LDA parameters\" displays four parameter values to set. The first is the bin width used to bin the MS2 fragments and losses. Defaults for Q-Exactive (0.005 Da) and ToF (0.01 Da) Data are provided. For instruments like Ion Traps a larger bin width of 0.1 Da is recommended. The appropriate bin width to choose is dependent on the expected mass variation of mass fragments across mass spectra in your data. The number of LDA iterations is set to 1000 by default which should work in most cases. The Minimum MS2 Intensity is meant to filter out the basic noise from the MS/MS spectra. It is recommended to open the inputted MGF file and check the noise levels. Typically they range from 25-200 (ToF Data) to 5000 (Q-Exactive Data). Inclusion of noise will unnecessarily lengten the analysis time and create non-informative Mass2Motifs. The LDA Free Motifs correspond to the number of \"free Mass2Motifs\" that are added on top of the prefixed annotated Mass2Motifs from MotifDB. This number depends on your data: if you input a larger number of fragmented molecules (i.e., > 4,000) that includes lots of novel chemistry not present in MotifDB it is best to put the LDA Free Motifs on 300 - 500. If the data set is relatively small with a considerable amount of known chemistry, you best put this number to 50 - 150. Selecting MotifDB Motif Sets By default all Motif Sets will be imported from MotifDB . However, it is wise to exclude annotated motif sets of sources that are very distant from the source of your input data. Note that the GNPS and MassBank are annotated Mass2Motifs discovered in reference molecules. Output Networking File Thresholds After running MS2LDA, output files are created that include a new networking (edge) file that can be used to create an enriched Molecular Network including Mass2Motif distributions through the Molecular Families. To do so, cut-off values (thresholds) are needed for LDA scores to consider a Mass2Motif to be linked to a molecule or not and how many you want to show in the network. Default values are provided that were found to work well so far. In this publication the two scores are explained: probability and overlap score. The Figure (from van der Hooft, Anal. Chem. 2017 89147569-7577 ) below illustrates the overlap score (O) and probability threshold (P) with two hypothetical molecular spectra and three hypothetical Mass2Motifs. In example A, molecule 1 has an overlap score of 1 with Mass2Motif 1 as the motif is in the molecule in its entirety. The probability of this connection is 0.5 as it accounts for half of the molecule\u2019s total intensity. In example B, the same molecule has an overlap score of (approximately) 0.5 with Mass2Motif 2 as it includes roughly half of the Mass2Motif. Note that you will have to provide your email address in the appropriate field in order to be notified upon completion of your GNPS-MS2LDA job. MS2LDA Output Files Upon succesful completion, you will be able to see the output job page as displayed below: There are different views and files for download available: View Motif Labels for Spectra This view displays all the fragmented molecules (scans) and each of the motifs linked to them [above the set thresholds as specified in the Output Networking file thresholds]. It can be downloaded as a tab separated file. Individual Motif Details This view displays all molecule-motif links [some molecules have more than one motif linked and will appear multiple times in this table] and also shows the annotation if available from MotifDB. It can be downloaded as a tab separated file. View Pairs with Motif Edges This view is the new edge file enriched with Motif interactions: note that in the \"Interact\" column apart from cosine now different Mass2Motifs are listed [above the set thresholds as specified in the Output Networking file thresholds]. It can be downloaded as a tab separated file - this can be used to create a new enriched Molecular Network in CytoScape. View Motif PDF This displays a PDF report of all the Mass2Motifs. Each Mass2Motif spans two pages with the first page a graphical overview of the relevant mass fragments (red, on top, pointing up) and neutral losses (green, bottom, pointing down) with the y-axis being the intensity which equals the features' probability to be found in the Mass2Motif, and the x-axis being the m/z (rounded up to nominal values in the labels) in Daltons. The second page displays the top mass fragments and neutral losses with their probabilities. Download Motif PDF This downloads the PDF report as explained in \"View Motif PDF\". Download Pairs This downloads the new edge file as explained in \"View Pairs with Motif Edges\". Download MS2LDA Dict This downloads the MS2LDA Dict file that houses all the relevant information on the MS2LDA experiment. Analysing the MS2LDA results Analysing the results in GNPS The different available views enable a quick overview of the MS2LDA experiment. Especially when annotated Mass2Motifs are found, this could help in further downstream analysis. However, when no annotation is provided, the Mass2Motif is one of the \"free Motifs\" that was discovered by LDA. With the MS2LDA Dict file through the MS2LDA web app there are ways to analyse these Mass2Motifs further and also annotate them. In general, when analysing annotating or novel Mass2Motifs, it is important to keep this in mind! Taking the results to MS2LDA web app Uploading the dictionary to MS2LDA web app After downloading the MS2LSA Dict file from the finished MS2LDA experiment, this can be uploaded into the MS2LDA web app . There is a User Guide available that covers the main functionalities of the MS2LDA web app. If it is your first time at the MS2LDA web app, make sure you get a login account before continuing. Once logged in, go to the experiments section: By default, you arrive on the Create tab which lets you create an MS2LDA experiment from mass spectrometry data. Click on the Upload tab, to continue: Now, you will have to provide a unique name for the MS2LDA experiment and you can also provide relevant details. Most importantly, you will need to select the location of the downloaded MS2LDA Dict file under \"LDA output file\". Also, you will need to select the bin width as used in the GNPS-MS2LDA workflow (\"Bin Width\") from the available options. After you are ready, you can click \"Upload Your Experiment\" and the upload will start. Viewing the Experiment Results Once the MS2LDA dict file finished uploading, you can browse the MS2LDA experiment in the web app like a regular MS2LDa experiment. If you click on the experiment name, multiple tabs will appear: Here, you can click on the Summary Page tab which leads you to the summary of the experiment that includes all relevant Tables. For example, the Motif Table can be browsed, sorted, searched, and downloaded as CSV: Annotating Motifs When clicking on the relevant \"free Motif\" name a Motif Page will appear where the relevant mass fragment and neutral losses are listed including their scores and a frequency plot. Also, all the spectra the Mass2Motif appears in can be browsed to analyse the nature of the fragmentation pattern. Importantly, if you can annote the motif with any structural information, this can be provided on top of the page with the Annotation field for the full annotation and the Short Annotation field for a label to display in graphics - make sure to save the Motif Page afterwards! After reloading the Summary Page or the Show Mass2Motif tabs, the annotation(s) will be displayed and are searchable. Finally, on top of the summary page there is a toggle where you can make the entire MS2LDA experiment public. See for example the public MassBank Experiment . MS1 Differential Analyses within the MS2LDA web app If the Feature based Molecular Networking workflow was used, the MS1 peak information is available in the MS2LDA Dict file. This can be used to create MS1 analysis to find Mass2Motif that are discriminative between two sample groups. More information can be found in this publication and the MS2LDA web app User Guide explains how to set up such an analysis within your experiment. Uploading annotated motif sets into MotifDB This is a future feature that will become available in the course of this year. It will allow you to make your new annotations searchable and usable by the community. Future Directions At GNPS, we are working with the MS2LDA team to promote publication of curated sets of Mass2Motifs into MotifDB that can help to annotate your MS/MS spectra.

Available options are: GNPS, HMDB, SUPNAT, CHEBI, DRUGBANK and FooDB. Be aware that these databases are static and new changes on the source databases are not incorporated automatically. Input an in house generated database. See Molecular Networking documentation to learn how to use the drag and drop upload. A standard format is required for the in house database. One can easily collect structures in the literature and format a tab separated files with SMILES strings and a character identifier of any kind, as the example database Right-click, and Save link as : Having an in house collection, before the use in NAP, the user has to first format the database, using the following webserver : After submission for conversion the user should receive an email with the link to download a file in the following format Right-click, and Save link as : The combination of the two databases above. NAP allows the combination of different databases, either through multiple database identifiers, or by the combination of identifiers and text file. While this feature allows flexibility, it is important narrow the search space for the system under study. Running NAP NAP Workflow Selection From the main GNPS page , you can access NAP clicking the banner and then selecting NAP in the corresponding description. You can also directly open clicking \"here\" . This will take you to the workflow input to start NAP. The image below shows an example of the most important parameters The first parameter is the GNPS network task id, this id can be found in the results email sent by GNPS or in the url, as shown in the image below, the task id is '3b215c4b25594b9c85d92de547815c0a' and the molecular family (connected component) containing the 'cluster index' 56 can be inspected in the molecular network . A detailed description of the parameters is provided below . Parameter Walkthrough Parameter Description Default GNPS job ID GNPS molecular networking task id. Number of a cluster index Any cluster index of a connected component of interest in a Molecular Network. The propagation is limited by the connected component. Cosine value to subselect inside a cluster Used to disconnect nodes in very dense molecular networks and decrease the number of nodes to be analyzed. 0.5 N first candidates for consensus score Number of candidate structures of the neighbor nodes used for Consensus re-ranking. 10 Use fusion result for consensus Whether to use the result from Fusion re-ranking to perform Consensus re-ranking. 1 Accuracy for exact mass candidate search (ppm) Accuracy used for structure database search. The predicted neutral mass (for a given adduct selected) is compared to the exact mass of the structures provided. 15 Acquisition mode Mass spectrometry acquisition mode. Positive Adduct ion type Expected adduct type for the precursor ion mass. [M+H] Multiple adduct types Input one or more adducts, separated by \",\". Available options are: listed on the Adduct drop down menu. Structure databases Input one or more databases, separated by \",\". Available options are: GNPS , HMDB , SUPNAT , CHEBI , DRUGBANK and FooDB . Use none to select only user defined. Compound class to be selected ClassyFire class in the following format: \"class:name\". User provided database In house candidate structure database to be used in the search. Skip parent mass selection Should be used only in combination with class selection. 0 User provided MetFrag parameter file Check here for a template. Maximum number of candidate structures in the graph: Number od candidate structures to be exported in the Cytoscape graph. 10 Workflow type Standard or MZmine . Online Exploration of NAP results After completing a NAP workflow, the results can be browsed in the web interface. The web interface provides a quick and easy way to perform initial analysis of your data, particularly if you are interested in a specific structure or class of structures and want to inspect in the results. To have access to the web interface click on the 'EXPERIMENTAL - NAPviewer' at the results page: The result summaries can be divided in four sections. 1. Structure view NAP attempts to re-rank the candidate structures provided by MetFrag using the information provided by the molecular network. This first view shows the S tructures ranked by MetFrag and the ones re-ranked by NAP to allow the user to quickly inspect if the propagation improved the ranking: 2. Graph view As the re-ranking is performing obtaining information from neighbor nodes, the G raph view displays the direct neighbor's first candidate structures of a given re-ranked node to allow the user to inspect if the re-ranking is consistent in the network: The node border colors indicate the source of structure: green - reference spectral library structure; magenta MetFrag's first candidate; blue Fusion's first candidate and red Consensus' first candidate. 3. Fragment view Some important aspects of structural prediction are: how many fragments were predicted, which fragments and which substructures were assigned to the predictions. The F ragment view displays the direct fragments predicted for each structure in the candidate list of a given fragmentation spectrum (represented by a node in the network): By hovering the mouse over the candidate fragment it is possible to see the substructure predicted for the fragment. 4. Full candidate list view As structural prediction is very challenging. The correct candidate may not be the first in the list, therefore it is important to be able to browse the candidate list. The Link containing the full list of candidate structures found in NAP search is provided. The first column of the candidate's table contains a link out for the respective database where the structure was originated. The table also contains the ranking for MetFrag, Fusion and Consensus, the link for number of fragments predicted for each candidate structure, a link to fragment plot representation and a column with color coded structural similarity grouping that can be easily associated with candidate's ClassyFire class, when available: NAP Visualization in Cytoscape In a similar way as Molecular Networking uses Cytoscape to visualize the whole network, we can visualize structure prediction of entire connected component or networks using the output from NAP. Cytoscape (we have used version >= 3.4) is available for download from here . Download NAP Cytoscape files To download NAP's Cytoscape file, go back to the results page of your task: and download the compacted file containing the 'structure_graph_alt.xgmml' file. After the download, remember to uncompress the file for downstream use. Installing the ChemViz plugin To visualize the structures on NAP output we need the ChemViz plugin. The easiest way to install it is using Cytoscape's App Manager, as shown below: Load NAP Cytoscape file and apply layout Load the 'structure_graph_alt.xgmml' file: and apply a layout to spread the nodes: Change image display properties and paint library match structure The 'structure_graph_alt.xgmml' file contains some pre-set elements to aid structure display. Nodes possessing a structure are empty squares. Node borders are either green (spectral library match) or blue (in silico prediction). In silico predictions can be a combination of MetFrag, Fusion and Consensus. Browsing the 'Table Panel' is possible to inspect which scoring method has structures available in the columns MetFrag/Fusion/ConsensusSMILES. To use one of these columns to display the structures we have first to change the properties of ChemViz, by doing: After setting the desired source column to display the structure one can just 'paint' the structure on the node: Change display properties and paint on multiple nodes As we described in the publications below we have a decreasing order of confidence on structural prediction spectral library match > Fusion scoring > Consensus scoring > MetFrag scoring. To change for Fusion scoring structures you can do: and paint the structures: Display the list of candidates As discussed in the Online Exploration section, the most correct structure may not be the first candidate. Therefore we can display the structures outputted from our initial parameters : Citation da Silva, Ricardo R., Mingxun Wang, Louis-F\u00e9lix Nothias, Justin JJ van der Hooft, Andr\u00e9s Mauricio Caraballo-Rodr\u00edguez, Evan Fox, Marcy J.

This visualization approach can detect sets of spectra from related molecules (molecular networks), even when the spectra themselves are not matched to any known compounds. The visualization of molecular networks in GNPS represents each spectrum as a node, and spectrum-to-spectrum alignments as edges (connections) between nodes. Nodes can be supplemented with metadata, including dereplication matches or information that is provided by the user, e.g. as abundance, origin of product, biochemical activity, or hydrophobicity, which can be reflected in a node\u2019s size or color. This map of all related molecules is visualized as a global molecular network. For more information about Molecular Networking check out the GNPS publication from 2016. Data Input Preparation The follow data is can be put into molecular networking. Mass Spectrometry data files (required) Metadata/Group Mapping (optional) `ili 3D mapping files (optional) Mass Spectrometry data files Molecular networking supports mzXML, mzML, and mgf file formats. To convert your file to the appropriate formats, check out our documentation . Metadata More information provided here . Running Molecular Networking Molecular Networking Workflow Selection From the main GNPS page , click the \"Create Molecular Network\" button. This will bring you to the workflow input to start networking. Provide a detailed title for your molecular network. This title will be helpful when you retrieve your data after the workflow is completed. Selecting Files to Analyze Select files for analysis by first clicking \"Select Input Files\". This bring a popup window. We can select our own files to analyze. Alternatively, we can import an existing public dataset if we know the dataset accession ( Browse Datasets ). From the Select Input Files popup, you will be a shares files tab. There you will find a box called Import Data Share. In this box you may enter an accession of a MassIVE dataset. Upon clicking import the dataset will appear in your workspace to select input files to analyze from. Organizing Selected Files into Groups By default, files can be categorized into separate groups (G1, G2, etc.). For example, case and control or two different microbes can be separate groups. Using the basic options, only six groups can be created. Individual files or entire folders can be selected. Click Finish Selection which will close the pop-up window. Parameter Walkthrough Basic Options Parameter Description Default Precursor ion mass tolerance (PIMT) Parameter used for MS-Cluster and spectral library search. Specify the precursor ions mass tolerance, in Daltons. This value influences the aforementioned clustering of nearly-identical MS/MS spectra via MS-Cluster. Note that the value of this parameters should be consistent with the capabilities of the mass spectrometer and the specific instrument method used to generated the MS/MS data. Recommended Values value is \u00b1 0.02 Da for high-resolution instruments (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap) and \u00b1 2.0 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ). 2.0 Fragment Ion Mass Tolerance (FIMT) Parameters used for MS-Cluster, molecular networking, and MS/MS spectral library searches. For every group of MS/MS spectra being considered for clustering (consensus spectrum creation), this value specifies how much fragment ions can be shifted from their expected m/z values. Recommended Values value is \u00b1 0.02 Da for high-resolution instruments (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap) and \u00b1 0.5 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ). 0.5 Advanced Network Options Parameter Description Default Notes Min Pairs Cos Minimum cosine score that must occur between a pair of consensus MS/MS spectra in order for an edge to be formed in the molecular network. 0.7 Lower value will increase the size of the clusters by inducing the clustering of less related MS/MS spectra, higher value will limit do the opposite. Minimum Matched Fragment Ion (Min Matched Peaks) Parameters used for molecular networking. Is the minimum number of common fragment ions that are shared by two separate consensus MS/MS spectra in order to be connected by an edge in the molecular network 6 A low value will permit linkages between spectra of molecules with few similar fragment ions, but it will result in many more less-related spectra being connected to the network. An higher value will do the opposite. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be adjusted depending on the experimental conditions for mass spectra acquisition (such as mode of ionisation, fragmentation conditions, and the mobile phase, ...), and the collision-induced fragmentation behavior of the molecules of interest within the samples. High molecular weight (MW) compounds, and compounds with more hetero-atoms will generally tend to produce more fragment ions. However, this rule cannot be systematized. For example, some lipids with high MW generate only few fragment ions. Note that spectra with fewer than 5 fragment ions will by default not be considered for networking and result in single nodes. Node TopK Maximum number of neighbor nodes for one single node 10 The edge between two nodes are kept only if both nodes are within each other's \u2018TopK\u2019 most similar nodes. For example, if this value is set at 20, then a single node may be connected to up to 20 other nodes. Keeping this value low makes very large networks (many nodes) much easier to visualize. Minimum Cluster Size Minimum number of MS/MS spectra in a consensus MS/MS spectra to be considered for molecular networking 2 Requires MS-Cluster to be on. This parameter should be tuned based on the dataset size. See presets below Run MSCluster Cluster MS/MS spectra before networking Yes MSCluster will analyze every MS/MS spectra resulting from ions that fall within the defined precursor ion mass tolerance, and will merge the nearly-identical MS/MS spectra (above the cosine score) into a single consensus MS/MS spectrum. Each consensus MS/MS spectrum usually consist of multiple MS/MS spectra from across multiple LC-MS runs (or data files) Maximum Connected Component Size Maximum size of nodes allowed in a single connected network 100 Maximum size of nodes allowed in a single connected network. Nodes within a single connected molecular network will be separated by increasing cosine threshold for that specific connected molecular network. Default value is 100. Use 0 to allow an unlimited number of nodes in a single network. Note that with large datasets, or when a great number of related molecules are in the dataset, this value should be higher (or turn to 0) to retain as much information as possible. Downstream, these larger networks can be visualized using Cytoscape layout algorithms that can increase the intra-network clustering, allowing to visualize spectral groups in the network despite the number of nodes in the network. Metadata File Text input to describe experimental setup Replaces both Group mapping and Attribute Mapping Group Mapping Input text file organizing input files into groups Input text file organizing input files into groups. used as a more flexible alternative to assigning groups during data input selection. Attribute Mapping Attribute mapping eases visualization of different groups within cytoscape Input text file organizing groups into attributes Advanced Library Search Options Parameter Description Default Library Search Min Matched Peaks Minimum number of common fragment ions that MS/MS spectra should contain in order to be considered for spectral library annotation. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be tuned depending of the molecule of interest, and the experimental conditions (such as the ionisation mode, and the fragmentation conditions, ...). For example, collision-induced fragmentation of some lipids produce only few fragment ions. A lower value will allow clustering of MS/MS spectra containing less fragment ions, however it will also induce clustering of MS/MS spectra from different molecular-type to be connected in one network. An higher value will do the opposite 6 Score Threshold Minimum cosine score that MS/MS spectra should get in spectral matching with MS/MS spectral libraries in order to be considered an annotation. 0.7 Search Analogs Will search data for analogs to library spectra Don't Search Maximum Analog Search Mass Difference Maximum mass shift between library and putative analog found 100 (Da) Advanced Filtering Options Parameter Description Default Notes Filter stdDev Intensity Deprecated 0 Not recommended to change Minimum Fragment Ion Intensity All fragment ions in the MS/MS spectrum below this raw intensity will be deleted. By default, no filter. 0 Reduce to 0 if your data's raw intensities are very low. Filter Precursor Ion Window All peaks in a +/- 17 Da around precursor ion mass are deleted. By default, yes filter. This removes the residual precursor ion, which is frequently observed in MS/MS spectra acquired on qTOFs. Filter Filter library Apply peak filters to library Filter Filter peaks in 50Da Window Filter out peaks that are not top 6 most intense peaks in a +/- 50Da window Filter Turn off if your data is very small molecules as it might filter out a lot peaks in the lower mass ranges that might be signal.

In Meshlab, use the PickPoint tool to point coordinates in the model as figure below. A list with the coordinates will appear in the new box, and you can rename them according to your data. After that, a .csv table containing the coordinates and the .stl pointed model should be exported from Meshlab. More details about how to create a .csv table with the coordinates can be found here . The coordinates must be added in the metadata (.txt format) according to ReDU format . All files should be selected according to indicated below: Finish selection and set the parameters to create the Molecular Network. More details regarding Classic Molecular Network can be found here . To create \u00ecli visualization you must go in the Advanced Output Options and change the \u00ecli Mapping Output to \u201cCreate\u201d . Submit the job. Once the job was done, click on \u201cView \u00ecli in GNPS\u201d to visualize the feature mapping. A window for visualization will open. You can explore your data changing the feature in the bottom right. You can also set different parameters in the right window, such as the size of the spot or the color of mapping. There, you will also find some more examples to explore.

To view all the input MS/MS spectra that went into the consensus spectrum, click the link in the \"ClusterIdx\" link This brings up all the input MS/MS spectra. To visualize each spectrum, we can click the \"View Spectrum\" button. View Spectral Families View Spectra Families allows users to look at the molecular networks at a higher level. Users can see all the distinct spectral families that comprise the entire molecular network. These spectral families are all the nodes that are connected to each other. From here users can tell how big each component is, how many raw spectra are captured by the particular component, and also the libraries identifications of all the spectra in each component. To visualize each network, click on the \"Visualize Network\" link This brings up an in-browser visualization for a given spectral family Here users can explore the specific spectral family in the molecular network. Each circle (node) in the left network panel represents a consensus spectrum and edge represents related fragmentation patterns. The default color of the nodes is gray, with blue nodes representing consensus MS/MS spectra that were identified by library search. There is a lot to unpack in this online interface to explore the molecular networks. The following is a quick guide to all the features in this interface Node Labels Edge Labels Edge Highlight Node Highlights by MS2 Peak Search Align MS/MS spectra in right panels Node Size/Color Selection Node Pie Chart Coloring Rerun Network Layout Expand Network Window Toggle UI Widgets (Show/Hide) Download Spectral Family GraphML for Cytoscape Download Spectrum Peaks Annotate Spectrum with Peptide Sequence Large Spectrum Plot Show Peak m/z annotations in Spectrum Viewer Network Labeling The default labeling is the cluster/node index which is rather uninformative, but there are alternative labelings possible by selecting the appropriate node label from the Node Label legend box. Node Labels Label Description cluster index cluster index used globally for each cluster across all networking views parent mass precursor mass of the consensus spectrum LibraryID library identification name for the node if a library search were performed EvenOdd 1/0 for even or odd depending on the parent mass. Used for nitrogen rule Peptide peptide labeling None No Labeling Edge Labels Label Description Cosine Cosine score measuring fragmentation similarity between two nodes DeltaMZ The Delta MZ of the spectra None No Labeling Node Pie Coloring An additional way to customize the view of the networks is to color the nodes. By default the nodes are gray, but users can color the nodes based upon spectra counts of the groups they came from. By default the coloring labels will be based upon the default groups G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, and G6. The coloring of each node will be a pie, and the proportion colored of that pie is the proportion of the spectral counts coming from each respective group. Additionally, the Node Coloring legend describes the color for each group. Users can also use their own group names if they defined their own arbitrary groups when creating the network. To draw the pies, click \"Draw Pies\" Edge Highlights Edges by default include arrows pointing from low mass spectra to high mass spectra. Further, edges can also be colored. Users are able to enter a delta mz of their choice to highlight in the network. The highlighted edges will appear in red. Edge Directions The arrows between nodes in the molecular network point from higher m/z spectra to lower m/z spectra. This can facilitate tracking down identifying multiple extensions of a polymer or extension of a carbon chain. Edge Delta Histogram This histogram shows the distribution of the edge deltas. Clicking each peak in the histogram allows for highlighting the edges in the network. Node Sizing/Color The nodes size and color can be adjusted based upon several options: Spectrum counts Precursor intensity Number of Files Parent Mass Nitrogen Even/Odd Precursor Charge MS2 Peak Search in Molecular Network To search for specific molecules in the molecular network that contain an MS2 fragment of interest, you can enter a product ion m/z you want to find. First, we need to grab all the MS/MS spectra into the browser by clicking this button: Then, we can enter the m/z we want to search for and click the update button. This will highlight which molecules contain the specific product ion. We can also see a histogram of all product ions from all MS2 spectra in the current network. Detailed Interrogation of Network Spectra While its great to visualize the network properly, to truly make sense of the network users must be able to interrogate the network metadata and examine the actual spectra. To this end, users are able to find out information about a particular node by simply hovering their mouse over node. This will bring up a hover box describing the node information. At present the display shows like this: This shows basic information about the node, as well as the structure if the node is identified by library search and the structure was provided in the library spectrum. To further investigate the network, users can left click on a node to plot the spectrum in the top right panel (right click to plot in bottom right panel), along with the spectrum information and structure if one is available. The spectrum image is interactive so users can zoom in and look at precisely at the spectrum to make sense of the data. Additionally users can compare two spectra in the network by simple right clicking on a different node to render its information in the bottom right panel. Users can also click on an edge and both nodes that are connected to the edge are automatically displayed in the top and bottom right panels. Examining Spectrum Spectrum Alignment Users can quickly ascertain how two spectra align to each other at the peak level. By clicking the \"Align Spec\" button to obtain the score between the spectrum in the top and the spectrum in the bottom render panels. Additionally, the plots of the spectra will update to reflect the alignments shown here: with red peaks representing peaks that match at the exact same masses between the top and bottom spectra, and blue peaks representing peaks matching at shifted masses. Additionally, each peak is labeled with a unique identification number that shows the correspondence of peak matches between the top and bottom spectra. Network Spectra Library Matches To view how exactly a spectrum in the network has matched to a library spectrum, users can click the \"Show Library Match\" in the side panel on the far right. This will bring up this middle panel shown below comparing the spectrum in the network with the library spectrum in green. Network Screen Shot Download screenshot of the molecular network.

Spectral Similarity Related to Molecular Structure Similarity A key concept in tandem mass spectrometry is that repeated MS/MS acquisitions of a molecule under the same experimental conditions (e.g. same instrument, collision energy, abundance, charge state) will yield highly similar MS/MS spectra. That is, fragmentation of molecules is consistent. This enables the identification of MS/MS spectra to libraries of reference compounds. Extending this concept, we have observed that structurally related molecules also exhibit similar fragmentation, with some caveats. Intuitively, two molecules that differ by the addition of a single chemical moiety, which does not contribute to a significant difference in molecule mass and not drastically change the bond energies of the molecule (e.g. Oxidation, methylation, glycosylation), will not drastically perturb the gas phase chemistry of fragmentation. Given that relative bond strengths between the two molecules do not drastically differ, the same bonds will undergo similar fragmentation within the collision cell of the mass spectrometer. The resulting corresponding product ions in the MS/MS spectra from the two molecules will either include the additional chemical moiety or will not. In cases fragments do not, the chemical moiety could either have Not been part of the product ion substructure Cleaved off prior to product ion formation Since corresponding product ions between structurally similar molecules can either have moiety or not, the product ions can either Appear at the exact same mass for both molecules Appear shifted by the mass of the chemical moiety Watrous et al. PNAS We consider both of these possibilities for each and every peak between two MS/MS spectra and explore how we do that below. Spectrum Alignment We will use a toy example here to demonstrate intuitively how we are able to consider an alignment between two MS/MS spectra. Given two molecules that differ by a single chemical moiety that each produce fragmentation as shown We can consider that each peak from molecule A, could align at the same mass in molecule B, or at an offset of Mass(Delta). One possible alignment is all peaks in A, align at the same mass Another, where the first peak aligns at the same mass, the second at an offset Third, where the first peak aligns at an offset, and the second aligns at the same mass Finally, where both peaks align at an offset All of these potential alignments can be explored and the best scoring alignment is determined between the two MS/MS spectra and is called the alignment score. The total number of potential alignments is exponential (2 ^ N, where N is the number of peaks) and is computationally expensive. GNPS has implemented algorithms that can efficiently approximate this alignment. Alignment of Entire Dataset So far we've investigated how to align one MS/MS spectrum to another, but have not created molecular networks across an entire dataset of MS/MS spectra. Since we do not know a priori, which MS/MS spectra will be structurally similar to any others, we must try aligning all MS/MS spectra within a dataset to all others. GNPS calculates the score between all MS/MS spectra within a dataset that provides the starting point of a molecular network. Network Filtering for Visualization The alignments between all MS/MS spectra must be filtered in order to produce molecular networks that can be visualized and interpretable. Alignment Score Filtering The most basic filter is by alignment score between MS/MS spectra. Generally, the default of cosine of 0.7 and 6 minimum matches peaks reduces the number of false positive alignments tremendously. Neighbor Top K A pathological case in Molecular Networks are promiscuous MS/MS spectra that align to many other MS/MS spectra due to a low complexity of fragmentation. To counteract this, only retain alignments between alignments between MS/MS spectra that mutually rank each other highly in the alignment score. Just like in human relationships, who wants a best friend who has a million other best friends? Connected Component Max Size Even with the above filters, the occasional false positive connections causes hairball networks that make visualization/interpretation difficult. The connected component size filter limits the maximum size of a single molecular network to a parameterized number of nodes (100 by default). This process iteratively breaks up large hairball networks by removing the lowest scoring alignments (by cosine score) first until the resulting pieces fall below the maximum size. Limitation of Molecular Networking Multiple Modifications Molecular networking is unable to align spectra from molecules that differ by two distinct structural modifications. We have observed that this limitation is ameliorated in biological datasets because chemical modifications are enzymatically catalyzed. In the event that two molecules differ by two distinct chemical modification which cannot be connected by molecular networking, an intermediate molecule which differs by only a single chemical modification to the respective molecules and links all three molecules into a molecular family.","title":"Molecular Networking"},{"location":"massspecbackground/networkingtheory/#molecular-networking-theory","text":"While there are many publications out there giving algorithmic and intuition into molecular networking, we attempt a cliff notes version here.","title":"Molecular Networking Theory"},{"location":"massspecbackground/networkingtheory/#spectral-similarity-related-to-molecular-structure-similarity","text":"A key concept in tandem mass spectrometry is that repeated MS/MS acquisitions of a molecule under the same experimental conditions (e.g. same instrument, collision energy, abundance, charge state) will yield highly similar MS/MS spectra.

All of the data must be collected using the same GC protocol. How to reach GC interface (MSHub) or clone the job Select the files that need to be processed and click \u201cSubmit\u201d (no explicit settings need to be entered as MSHub determines optimal settings internally without user input). When the job has completed, the feature table and .mgf file for all detected features could be downloaded by clicking \u201c[ all_features_table ]\u201d and \u201c[Download Quant Table]\u201d. To create and launch GNPS library search job: When feature detection job is completed, the link \u201claunch library search\u201d will become available. Clicking this link will launch library search job. Alternatively, the .mgf file of all features downloaded from the feature detection workflow could be uploaded in the same way as the original data. The file can then be selected by clicking \u201cSpectrum Files\u201d under \u201cSearch Options\u201d tab and selecting the uploaded .mgf file. Once files have been selected, the popup window can be closed by clicking on \u201cFinish Selection\u201d. NOTE: The default parameters recommended for obtaining good results have been determined and prepopulated. However, users are encouraged to adjust the settings as appropriate for their analysis. After the appropriate settings are entered, the job can be launched by clicking Submit\u201d. Parameter Explanation Advanced Network Options Fillable Field Description Recommended User Input Min pairs cos Minimum cosine score required for an edge to be formed between nodes 0.85 value is set as default. This value has been determined to effectively delineate subclasses and Levels 6 and 7. Node TopK Pairs of nodes are reported only if they are found to be best matches in the topK in both directions that are above the minimum cosine score. Default is set to 10. This value enables the network to be more or less stringent. Maximum connected component size Maximum number of nodes that can be connected in a single sub-network of a molecular network. This process iteratively breaks up large \u2018hairball\u2019 networks (of false positives) by removing the lowest scoring alignments (by cosine score) first until the resulting pieces fall below the maximum size. Default setting is 100 \u2013 this value can be set to 0 to allow for an unlimited number of nodes or a higher setting can be used for larger data sets or for data sets containing many structurally-related molecules Maximum shift between precursors The maximum allowed difference in precursor m/z differences. Must be set to a large value for EI data since no precursor information is available (default value of 500) ### Advanced Search Options Fillable Field Description Recommended User Input ------------- ------------- ------------- Library Class The level of library to include hits from. Keep default of \u201cBronze\u201d to include all possible hits including to public libraries. Top Hits Per Spectrum How many top hits ranked by the cosine score to include into the results. The default of 10. It is recommended to keep this number relatively high to allow for correct annotation selection if it is not a top hit. Spectral Library Selection of spectral libraries to include in the search. Make sure to select all appropriate EI libraries by selecting them and clicking \u201cLibrary Files\u201d. Click \u201cFinish Selection\u201d when completed. Search Analogs Used for tandem MS data. Keep default of \u201cDon\u2019t Search\u201d. Maximum Analog Search Mass Difference Maximum shift of the precursor m/z for analog search. Disabled when above option is set at \u201cDon\u2019t Search\u201d. ### Advanced Kovats Index Calculation Options Fillable Field Description Recommended User Input ------------- ------------- ------------- Perform Kovats Calculation Whether to perform calculation of Kovats retention index. Select to calculate Kovats RIs for the compounds during library search. The Input Carbon Marker File could be provided for Kovats markers as comma separated values for each of the carbon markers and its corresponding retention time. The analysis must be conducted with identical protocol as the rest of the experiment. If the Input Carbon Marker File is not provided, the Kovat\u2019s RIs will be estimated based on dataset-wide annotations. Input Carbon Marker File (Optional) If provided, this information will be used for RI estimation. The RI markers information should be submitted as a comma separated values (.csv) file in the following format (header followed by names or available reference compounds and their retention times in seconds) Cosine Threshold for Kovats Filter The minimal value of cosine score for the library match to be used for Kovats RI values assignment. Default value is set at 0.9 to limit inclusion of erroneous annotations that may introduce errors into calculation. Retention time window starts/ends (mins) The portion of chromatogram across the dataset to be used for selecting annotations for Kovats RI assignment. Select values according to specifics of experiment. The front end portion of chromatogram that contains dead volume elution, solvent delay, solvent peak or otherwise is unusable, as well as back end portion after all of the meaningful compounds have eluted (e.g. bakeout ramp) should be excluded. Kovats Index Filtering Window (+/- %) The allowable error window for the calculated/assigned Kovats RI for the annotation to be retained. Default of +/-10%. All of the annotations are shown when exploring results in the browser. The filtered results can be downloaded under \u201cDownload Filtered Computed Kovats Index Files\u201d link upon job completion. ### Advanced Filtering Option Fillable Field Description Recommended User Input ------------- ------------- ------------- Filter below std dev For use with tandem MS data. It is highly recommend to use a default value of 0 so that no filter is applied. Filter SNR Intensity All ions in the EI spectrum below this raw intensity will be deleted. Use a default value of 0 so that no filter is applied, especially if the raw intensities of your data are very low. Filter precursor window All peaks in a +/- 17 Da around precursor ion mass are deleted. This removes the residual precursor ion, which is frequently observed in tandem MS spectra in the comparison of all spectra for molecular networking. Don\u2019t Filter is set as default for the EI data. Filter library Applies the above precursor ion window filter to the library as well. Don\u2019t Filter is set as default for the EI data. Filter peaks in 50 Da window Removes peaks that are not one of the top 6 most intense within a +/- 50 Da window. Depending on the deconvolution results, this could be turned on or off: if fragmentation patterns contain a large number of small peaks, this filtering should be turned off, as it may filter out relevant peaks that could be signals. Assessing the results of library search Once the job has completed, the putative matches to all selected libraries could be viewed under one of the links: \u201cView All Spectra DB\u201d; \u201cView All Compounds\u201d; \u201cView Kovats Calculation Result\u201d. The possible annotations could be sorted by their cosine value and/or RI error rate to aid in selecting best annotation using researcher\u2019s judgement. In addition, the results could be downloaded as a table for all of the matches (\u201cDownload Not Filtered Computed Kovats Index Files\u201d) or matches filtered by the Kovats RI window set when launching the job (\u201cDownload Filtered Computed Kovats Index Files\u201d). If clicking on the \u201cView Kovats Calculation Result\u201d results in an error: \u201cThere was an error retrieving the result data for block \"main\" of workflow type \"MOLECULAR-LIBRARYSEARCH-GC\"\u201d, this is indication that the dataset does not contain sufficient number of reference points for polynomial fitting to generate satisfactory regression (it does not pass internal quality check). In this case submitting the information for RI reference markers is necessary to generate Kovats estimates for the submitted data. The results can be visualized as a network (see \u201cMolecular Networking\u201d and the \u201cBiological Case Study\u201d sections below) by downloading and importing the GraphML file \u201cDownload GraphML\u201d. The detailed View All Spectra DB This option will display all of the top matches for each feature and relevant information including retention time. The \u201cScan\u201d field corresponds to the feature number in the .mgf file generated at the feature detection step and corresponds to the number listed in the feature table. Clicking on the spectrum icon at the left side of the screen would show mirror plot that could be investigated. View All Compounds This option will display only the cop hits for each feature of the top match. \u201cView Kovats Calculation Result\u201d This option will display all of the top matches for each feature and in addition will list the information for the Kovats RI calculation or assignment. This information includes: Kovats_Index_Lib_Record This is the library value of Kovats RI for the match. In no record available, \u201cNone\u201d is listed. Kovats_Index_calculated This is the value of calculated or assigned value of the RI. Kovats_Index_Error This is the error between the calculated/assigned RI value and the library entry. If no library value was available, \u201cNone\u201d is listed. Capturing information by adding reference spectra from your data. High confidence spectra from experimental data or pure standards could be added as a reference spectrum to GNPS for future reference. Single spectrum submission If the user wishes to upload >50 reference spectra to GNPS, a batch upload should be used to as detailed in the online help documentation. The compliance of the file format can be verified using online tool. Data Sharing and Cloning a Job The analysis conducted on GNPS as well as the deposited raw data could be shared as a hyperlink to the GNPS job(s) and the MassIVE accession number, correspondingly. GNPS stores data inputs and setting used for the analyses of the data, so the analysis could be shared and reproduced. If the same analysis needs to be repeated, it is possible to clone the job by clicking \u2018clone\u2019 on the job status page. Cloning a job allows users to view all parameters and files that were used and rerun the job (feature detection or library search) with the same (or adjusted) parameters and files. Note that if data were imported from private user workspace and not from within MassIVE, other users will not have access to the data and consequently will not be able to rerun or reproduce the GNPS job. Troubleshooting Erro Description solution When clicking on \u201cView Kovats Calculation Result\u201d, error is displayed: \u201cThere was an error retrieving the result data for block \"main\" of workflow type \"MOLECULAR-LIBRARYSEARCH-GC\"\u201d The retention indices could not be reliably estimated from the annotations available within the dataset. Increasing the number of files, for example, by co-analyzing multiple datasets obtained with the same experimental protocol could resolve the issue. Alternatively, the information for the reference mix needs to be supplied. A large number of spectra appear as a single peak. Insufficient volume of data cause unstable deconvolution resulting in spurious low-quality spectra. Increasing the number of files, for example, by co-analyzing multiple datasets obtained with the same experimental protocol would resolve the issue. Otherwise, an external deconvolution could be carried out to ensure that the high quality spectral pattern are obtained.

Experimental Setup Microbial extracts from Streptomyces roseosporus and Streptomyces sp. DSM5940 were analyzed on an LTQ FT mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was operated in data dependent positive ion mode; automatically switching between full scan high resolution FT MS and low resolution LTQ MS/MS acquisitions. Full scan MS spectra were acquired in the FT and the top six most intense ions in a particular scan were fragmented using collision induced dissociation (CID) at a constant collision energy of 35eV, an activation Q of 0.25, and an activation time of 50 to 80 ms. Data Availability MS/MS data can be found in the MassIVE dataset MSV000079204 .
