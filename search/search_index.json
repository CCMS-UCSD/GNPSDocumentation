Below are additional guidelines that describe the kinds of data that GNPS's analysis tools and shared knowledgebase handle.\n\n\n\n\n\nIonization Type\n\n\nGNPS supports data from soft ionization sources, e.g. electro spray ionization (ESI), Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI), Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI).\n\n\nFragmentation\n\n\nGNPS only accepts data dependent acquisition data (DDA), i.e. molecules were fragmented with collision induced dissociation (CID), Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD), or Electron-transfer dissociation (ETD). This produces tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) that can be identified via spectral library search and organized into families of molecules with molecular networking.\n\n\nData Sizes\n\n\nGNPS was designed to process MS/MS datasets of entire LC/MS runs. Many of the analysis tools were meant for datasets with at least hundreds of MS/MS spectra. While it is feasible to analyze a small amount of MS/MS spectra, certain capabilities (e.g. Molecular Networking) will not be effective at such small scales.\n\n\nFor extremely small datasets (e.g. single MS/MS spectra), we recommend utilizing our \nmolecular BLAST search\n tool and not molecular networking.\n\n\nFor datasets that at least include an entire LC/MS run of MS/MS spectra, all workflows will accept. For molecular networking, please refer to the parameters and \npresets\n.\n\n\nFile Formats\n\n\nMass spectrometry files must be converted from proprietary vendor formats to open file formats. GNPS currently support .mzXML, .mzML, and .mgf formats for analysis. To convert, please see our \nconversion guide\n.\n\n\nOur tools do NOT support .mzData, .xml, .raw, .RAW, .wiff, .scan, .d, and .cdf formats.",

This approach groups sets of spectra from related molecules (known as molecular families) even when the spectra themselves are not identified (do not match to any known compounds).\n\n\nMolecular networks in GNPS represents each spectrum as a node, and spectrum-to-spectrum alignments as edges (similar fragmentation implying similar structure) between nodes.

That is, fragmentation of molecules is consistent. This enables the identification of MS/MS spectra to libraries of reference compounds.\n\n\nExtending this concept, we have observed that structurally related molecules also exhibit similar fragmentation, with some caveats. Intuitively, two molecules that differ by the addition of a single chemical moiety, which does not contribute to a significant difference in molecule mass and not drastically change the bond energies of the molecule (e.g. Oxidation, methylation, glycosylation), will not drastically perturb the gas phase chemistry of fragmentation.  \n\n\nGiven that relative bond strengths between the two molecules do not drastically differ, the same bonds will undergo similar fragmentation within the collision cell of the mass spectrometer. The resulting corresponding product ions in the MS/MS spectra from the two molecules will either include the additional chemical moiety or will not. In cases fragments do not, the chemical moiety could either have\n\n\n\n\nNot been part of the product ion substructure\n\n\nCleaved off prior to product ion formation\n\n\n\n\nSince corresponding product ions between structurally similar molecules can either have moiety or not, the product ions can either\n\n\n\n\nAppear at the exact same mass for both molecules\n\n\nAppear shifted by the mass of the chemical moiety\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatrous et al. PNAS\n\n\nWe consider both of these possibilities for each and every peak between two MS/MS spectra and explore how we do that below.\n\n\nSpectrum Alignment\n\n\nWe will use a toy example here to demonstrate intuitively how we are able to consider an alignment between two MS/MS spectra.\n\n\nGiven two molecules that differ by a single chemical moiety that each produce fragmentation as shown\n\n\n\n\nWe can consider that each peak from molecule A, could align at the same mass in molecule B, or at an offset of Mass(Delta). One possible alignment is all peaks in A, align at the same mass\n\n\n\n\nAnother, where the first peak aligns at the same mass, the second at an offset\n\n\n\n\nThird, where the first peak aligns at an offset, and the second aligns at the same mass\n\n\n\n\nFinally, where both peaks align at an offset\n\n\n\n\nAll of these potential alignments can be explored and the best scoring alignment is determined between the two MS/MS spectra and is called the alignment score.\n\n\nThe total number of potential alignments is exponential (2 ^ N, where N is the number of peaks) and is computationally expensive. GNPS has implemented algorithms that can efficiently approximate this alignment.\n\n\nAlignment of Entire Dataset\n\n\nSo far we've investigated how to align one MS/MS spectrum to another, but have not created molecular networks across an entire dataset of MS/MS spectra. Since we do not know a priori, which MS/MS spectra will be structurally similar to any others, we must try aligning all MS/MS spectra within a dataset to all others. GNPS calculates the score between all MS/MS spectra within a dataset that provides the starting point of a molecular network.\n\n\nNetwork Filtering for Visualization\n\n\nThe alignments between all MS/MS spectra must be filtered in order to produce molecular networks that can be visualized and interpretable.\n\n\nAlignment Score Filtering\n\n\nThe most basic filter is by alignment score between MS/MS spectra. Generally, the default of cosine of 0.7 and 6 minimum matches peaks reduces the number of false positive alignments tremendously.\n\n\nNeighbor Top K\n\n\nA pathological case in Molecular Networks are promiscuous MS/MS spectra that align to many other MS/MS spectra due to a low complexity of fragmentation. To counteract this, only retain alignments between alignments between MS/MS spectra that mutually rank each other highly in the alignment score. Just like in human relationships, who wants a best friend who has a million other best friends?\n\n\nConnected Component Max Size\n\n\nEven with the above filters, the occasional false positive connections causes hairball networks that make visualization/interpretation difficult. The connected component size filter limits the maximum size of a single molecular network to a parameterized number of nodes (100 by default). This process iteratively breaks up large hairball networks by removing the lowest scoring alignments (by cosine score) first until the resulting pieces fall below the maximum size.\n\n\nLimitation of Molecular Networking\n\n\nMultiple Modifications\n\n\nMolecular networking is unable to align spectra from molecules that differ by two distinct structural modifications. We have observed that this limitation is ameliorated in biological datasets because chemical modifications are enzymatically catalyzed. In the event that two molecules differ by two distinct chemical modification which cannot be connected by molecular networking, an intermediate molecule which differs by only a single chemical modification to the respective molecules and links all three molecules into a molecular family.",

This visualization approach can detect sets of spectra from related molecules (molecular networks), even when the spectra themselves are not matched to any known compounds.\n\n\nThe visualization of molecular networks in GNPS represents each spectrum as a node, and spectrum-to-spectrum alignments as edges (connections) between nodes. Nodes can be supplemented with metadata, including dereplication matches or information that is provided by the user, e.g. as abundance, origin of product, biochemical activity, or hydrophobicity, which can be reflected in a node\u2019s size or color. This map of all related molecules is visualized as a global molecular network.\n\n\nFor more information about Molecular Networking check out the \nGNPS publication\n from 2016.\n\n\nData Input Preparation\n\n\nThe follow data is can be put into molecular networking.\n\n\n\n\nMass Spectrometry data files (required)\n\n\nMetadata/Group Mapping (optional)\n\n\n`ili 3D mapping files (optional)\n\n\n\n\nMass Spectrometry data files\n\n\nMolecular networking supports mzXML, mzML, and mgf file formats. To convert your file to the appropriate formats, check out our \ndocumentation\n.\n\n\nMetadata\n\n\nThe metadata file describes the samples properties and allows more flexibility for data analysis and visualization. It is an alternative way to assign groups when selecting data input files within the workflow of GNPS.\n\n\nThe current version of molecular networking allows to use the metadata table as an input. Although it is possible to use the legacy group mapping and attribute mapping file, we strongly advise to prepare metadata table instead.\n\n\nFormat\n\n\nThe metadata table is a text file (Tab separated) that users must create these file themselves using a text editor (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Notepad++ for Windows, gedit for Linux, TextWrangler for Mac OS). Using Metadata table can greatly ease the visualization and analysis of data within Cytoscape. We strongly encourage you to prepare those in advance and to share it publicly with your MassIVE data.\n\n\nYou can download an example and edit it appropriately. Finally users will need to upload just as you would upload data input files and select it in the metadata table file upload selection. For a metadata table file template, you can use the following .txt file - \nRight-click, and Save link as\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe only required columns in the metadata is \"filename\". NOTE: capitalization matters.\n\n\nMetadata columns that will be considered by molecular networking must be prefixed by \"ATTRIBUTE_\".\n\n\nPlease ensure that the file is saved as a tab separated text file. Excel (xlsx), rich text (rtf) are not acceptable.\n\n\nPardon our dust as we are migrating this documentation, if we missed anything, please check out our \nLegacy Documentation\n.\n\n\n`ili 3D Mapping Files\n\n\nThe metadata can also be used to specify spatial coordinates for direct visualization of the data in \n'ili toolbox\n. Note that an .STL binary file must selected as an input in the workflow.\n\n\nThe following headers are required:\n\n\n\n\n\"COORDINATE_X\" - X coordinate on the 2D/3D model\n\n\n\"COORDINATE_Y\" - Y coordinate on the 2D/3D model\n\n\n\"COORDINATE_Z\" - Z coordinate on the 2D/3D model\n\n\n\"COORDINATE_radius\" - radius for the spot in 'ili toolbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, a 3D STL file will need to be provided to visualize all the molecule intensities onto. It creates really cool plots like this:\n\n\n\n\nLegacy Group and Attribute Mapping Format\n\n\nThis format has been replaced by the above Metadata format. While it is still supported it is not recommended. Please see the details \nhere\n.\n\n\nRunning Molecular Networking\n\n\nMolecular Networking Workflow Selection\n\n\nFrom the main \nGNPS page\n, click the \n\"Create Molecular Network\"\n button.\n\n\n\n\nThis will bring you to the workflow input to start networking.\n\n\n\n\nProvide a detailed title for your molecular network. This title will be helpful when you retrieve your data after the workflow is completed.\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Files to Analyze\n\n\nSelect files for analysis by first clicking \"Select Input Files\".\n\n\n\n\nThis bring a popup window. We can select our own files to analyze.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can import an existing public dataset if we know the dataset accession (\nBrowse Datasets\n). From the Select Input Files popup, you will be a shares files tab. There you will find a box called Import Data Share. In this box you may enter an accession of a MassIVE dataset. Upon clicking import the dataset will appear in your workspace to select input files to analyze from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizing Selected Files into Groups\n\n\nBy default, files can be categorized into separate groups (G1, G2, etc.). For example, case and control or two different microbes can be separate groups. Using the basic options, only six groups can be created. Individual files or entire folders can be selected.\n\n\nClick Finish Selection which will close the pop-up window.\n\n\nParameter Walkthrough\n\n\nBasic Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecursor ion mass tolerance (PIMT)\n\n\nParameter used for MS-Cluster and spectral library search. Specify the precursor ions mass tolerance, in Daltons. This value influences the aforementioned clustering of nearly-identical MS/MS spectra via MS-Cluster. Note that the value of this parameters should be consistent with the capabilities of the mass spectrometer and the specific instrument method used to generated the MS/MS data. Recommended Values value is \u00b1 0.02 Da for high-resolution instruments (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap) and \u00b1 2.0 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ).\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFragment Ion Mass Tolerance (FIMT)\n\n\nParameters used for MS-Cluster, molecular networking, and MS/MS spectral library searches. For every group of MS/MS spectra being considered for clustering (consensus spectrum creation), this value specifies how much fragment ions can be shifted from their expected m/z values. Recommended Values value is \u00b1 0.02 Da for high-resolution instruments (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap) and \u00b1 0.5 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ).\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Network Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMin Pairs Cos\n\n\nMinimum cosine score that must occur between a pair of consensus MS/MS spectra in order for an edge to be formed in the molecular network.\n\n\n0.7\n\n\nLower value will increase the size of the clusters by inducing the clustering of less related MS/MS spectra, higher value will limit do the opposite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum Matched Fragment Ion (Min Matched Peaks)\n\n\nParameters used for molecular networking. Is the minimum number of common fragment ions that are shared by two separate consensus MS/MS spectra in order to be connected by an edge in the molecular network\n\n\n6\n\n\nA low value will permit linkages between spectra of molecules with few similar fragment ions, but it will result in many more less-related spectra being connected to the network. An higher value will do the opposite. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be adjusted depending on the experimental conditions for mass spectra acquisition (such as mode of ionisation, fragmentation conditions, and the mobile phase,  ...), and the collision-induced fragmentation behavior of the molecules of interest within the samples. High molecular weight (MW) compounds, and compounds with more hetero-atoms will generally tend to produce more fragment ions. However, this rule cannot be systematized. For example, some lipids with high MW generate only few fragment ions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode TopK\n\n\nMaximum number of neighbor nodes for one single node\n\n\n10\n\n\nThe edge between two nodes are kept only if both nodes are within each other's \u2018TopK\u2019 most similar nodes.  For example, if this value is set at 20, then a single node may be connected to up to 20 other nodes.  Keeping this value low makes very large networks (many nodes) much easier to visualize.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum Cluster Size\n\n\nMinimum number of MS/MS spectra in a consensus MS/MS spectra to be considered for molecular networking\n\n\n2\n\n\nRequires MS-Cluster to be on.

Each consensus MS/MS spectrum usually consist of multiple MS/MS spectra from across multiple LC-MS runs (or data files)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Connected Component Size\n\n\nMaximum size of nodes allowed in a single connected network\n\n\n100\n\n\nMaximum size of nodes allowed in a single connected network. Nodes within a single connected molecular network will be separated by increasing cosine threshold for that specific connected molecular network. Default value is 100. Use 0 to allow an unlimited number of nodes in a single network. Note that with large datasets, or when a great number of related molecules are in the dataset, this value should be higher (or turn to 0) to retain as much information as possible. Downstream, these larger networks can be visualized using Cytoscape layout algorithms that can increase the intra-network clustering, allowing to visualize spectral groups in the network despite the number of nodes in the network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetadata File\n\n\nText input to describe experimental setup\n\n\n\n\nReplaces both Group mapping and Attribute Mapping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Mapping\n\n\nInput text file organizing input files into groups\n\n\n\n\nInput text file organizing input files into groups. used as a more flexible alternative to assigning groups during data input selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute Mapping\n\n\nAttribute mapping eases visualization of different groups within cytoscape\n\n\n\n\nInput text file organizing groups into attributes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Library Search Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary Search Min Matched Peaks\n\n\nMinimum number of common fragment ions that MS/MS spectra should contain in order to be considered for spectral library annotation. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be tuned depending of the molecule of interest, and the experimental conditions (such as the ionisation mode, and the fragmentation conditions, ...). For example, collision-induced fragmentation of some lipids produce only few fragment ions. A lower value will allow clustering of MS/MS spectra containing less  fragment ions, however it will also induce clustering of  MS/MS spectra from different molecular-type to be connected in one network.

Minimum Matched Fragment Ion (Min Matched Peaks)  Parameters used for molecular networking. Is the minimum number of common fragment ions that are shared by two separate consensus MS/MS spectra in order to be connected by an edge in the molecular network  6  A low value will permit linkages between spectra of molecules with few similar fragment ions, but it will result in many more less-related spectra being connected to the network. An higher value will do the opposite. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be adjusted depending on the experimental conditions for mass spectra acquisition (such as mode of ionisation, fragmentation conditions, and the mobile phase,  ...), and the collision-induced fragmentation behavior of the molecules of interest within the samples. High molecular weight (MW) compounds, and compounds with more hetero-atoms will generally tend to produce more fragment ions. However, this rule cannot be systematized. For example, some lipids with high MW generate only few fragment ions.

Nodes within a single connected molecular network will be separated by increasing cosine threshold for that specific connected molecular network. Default value is 100. Use 0 to allow an unlimited number of nodes in a single network. Note that with large datasets, or when a great number of related molecules are in the dataset, this value should be higher (or turn to 0) to retain as much information as possible.
