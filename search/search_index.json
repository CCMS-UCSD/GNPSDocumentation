Below are additional guidelines that describe the kinds of data that GNPS's analysis tools and shared knowledgebase handle.\n\n\n\n\n\nIonization Type\n\n\nGNPS supports data from soft ionization sources, e.g. electro spray ionization (ESI), Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI), Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI).\n\n\nFragmentation\n\n\nGNPS only accepts data dependent acquisition data (DDA), i.e. molecules were fragmented with collision induced dissociation (CID), Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD), or Electron-transfer dissociation (ETD). This produces tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) that can be identified via spectral library search and organized into families of molecules with molecular networking.\n\n\nData Sizes\n\n\nGNPS was designed to process MS/MS datasets of entire LC/MS runs. Many of the analysis tools were meant for datasets with at least hundreds of MS/MS spectra. While it is feasible to analyze a small amount of MS/MS spectra, certain capabilities (e.g. Molecular Networking) will not be effective at such small scales.\n\n\nFor extremely small datasets (e.g. single MS/MS spectra), we recommend utilizing our \nMASST search\n tool and not molecular networking.\n\n\nFor datasets that at least include an entire LC/MS run of MS/MS spectra, all workflows will accept. For molecular networking, please refer to the parameters and \npresets\n.\n\n\nFile Formats\n\n\nMass spectrometry files must be converted from proprietary vendor formats to open file formats. GNPS currently support .mzXML, .mzML, and .mgf formats for analysis. To convert, please see our \nconversion guide\n.\n\n\nOur tools do NOT support .mzData, .xml, .raw, .RAW, .wiff, .scan, .d, and .cdf formats.",

The two ways to make your data public are to create MassIVE datasets that make entire datasets public or add individual annotated MS/MS spectra to GNPS spectral libraries.\n\n\nQ:\n Will MassIVE datasets that I create be public by default?\n\n\nA:\n No, when creating a MassIVE dataset, it is not public by default. On the input form page, you are able to set a password to access the MassIVE dataset. There is a Make Public link to make your dataset open to the public and documentation can be found here here. Such a feature is very useful because users can create a MassIVE dataset prior to publication submission that is private and password protected. The MassIVE dataset link can be provided to reviewers along with the password so to provide better transparency and increase probability of manuscript acceptance.\n\n\nData Organization\n\n\nQ:\n How does the MassIVE data differ from the GNPS spectral libraries?\n\n\nA:\n MassIVE datasets consist of raw data. GNPS spectral libraries consist of spectra that have been individually assigned an identification.\n\n\nQ:\n Can I create my own private spectral libraries?\n\n\nA:\n Yes, but it is not recommended.

That is, fragmentation of molecules is consistent. This enables the identification of MS/MS spectra to libraries of reference compounds.\n\n\nExtending this concept, we have observed that structurally related molecules also exhibit similar fragmentation, with some caveats. Intuitively, two molecules that differ by the addition of a single chemical moiety, which does not contribute to a significant difference in molecule mass and not drastically change the bond energies of the molecule (e.g. Oxidation, methylation, glycosylation), will not drastically perturb the gas phase chemistry of fragmentation.  \n\n\nGiven that relative bond strengths between the two molecules do not drastically differ, the same bonds will undergo similar fragmentation within the collision cell of the mass spectrometer.

One possible alignment is all peaks in A, align at the same mass\n\n\n\n\nAnother, where the first peak aligns at the same mass, the second at an offset\n\n\n\n\nThird, where the first peak aligns at an offset, and the second aligns at the same mass\n\n\n\n\nFinally, where both peaks align at an offset\n\n\n\n\nAll of these potential alignments can be explored and the best scoring alignment is determined between the two MS/MS spectra and is called the alignment score.\n\n\nThe total number of potential alignments is exponential (2 ^ N, where N is the number of peaks) and is computationally expensive. GNPS has implemented algorithms that can efficiently approximate this alignment.\n\n\nAlignment of Entire Dataset\n\n\nSo far we've investigated how to align one MS/MS spectrum to another, but have not created molecular networks across an entire dataset of MS/MS spectra. Since we do not know a priori, which MS/MS spectra will be structurally similar to any others, we must try aligning all MS/MS spectra within a dataset to all others. GNPS calculates the score between all MS/MS spectra within a dataset that provides the starting point of a molecular network.\n\n\nNetwork Filtering for Visualization\n\n\nThe alignments between all MS/MS spectra must be filtered in order to produce molecular networks that can be visualized and interpretable.\n\n\nAlignment Score Filtering\n\n\nThe most basic filter is by alignment score between MS/MS spectra. Generally, the default of cosine of 0.7 and 6 minimum matches peaks reduces the number of false positive alignments tremendously.\n\n\nNeighbor Top K\n\n\nA pathological case in Molecular Networks are promiscuous MS/MS spectra that align to many other MS/MS spectra due to a low complexity of fragmentation. To counteract this, only retain alignments between alignments between MS/MS spectra that mutually rank each other highly in the alignment score. Just like in human relationships, who wants a best friend who has a million other best friends?\n\n\nConnected Component Max Size\n\n\nEven with the above filters, the occasional false positive connections causes hairball networks that make visualization/interpretation difficult. The connected component size filter limits the maximum size of a single molecular network to a parameterized number of nodes (100 by default). This process iteratively breaks up large hairball networks by removing the lowest scoring alignments (by cosine score) first until the resulting pieces fall below the maximum size.\n\n\nLimitation of Molecular Networking\n\n\nMultiple Modifications\n\n\nMolecular networking is unable to align spectra from molecules that differ by two distinct structural modifications. We have observed that this limitation is ameliorated in biological datasets because chemical modifications are enzymatically catalyzed. In the event that two molecules differ by two distinct chemical modification which cannot be connected by molecular networking, an intermediate molecule which differs by only a single chemical modification to the respective molecules and links all three molecules into a molecular family.",

This visualization approach can detect sets of spectra from related molecules (molecular networks), even when the spectra themselves are not matched to any known compounds.\n\n\nThe visualization of molecular networks in GNPS represents each spectrum as a node, and spectrum-to-spectrum alignments as edges (connections) between nodes. Nodes can be supplemented with metadata, including dereplication matches or information that is provided by the user, e.g. as abundance, origin of product, biochemical activity, or hydrophobicity, which can be reflected in a node\u2019s size or color. This map of all related molecules is visualized as a global molecular network.\n\n\nFor more information about Molecular Networking check out the \nGNPS publication\n from 2016.\n\n\nData Input Preparation\n\n\nThe follow data is can be put into molecular networking.\n\n\n\n\nMass Spectrometry data files (required)\n\n\nMetadata/Group Mapping (optional)\n\n\n`ili 3D mapping files (optional)\n\n\n\n\nMass Spectrometry data files\n\n\nMolecular networking supports mzXML, mzML, and mgf file formats.

This title will be helpful when you retrieve your data after the workflow is completed.\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Files to Analyze\n\n\nSelect files for analysis by first clicking \"Select Input Files\".\n\n\n\n\nThis bring a popup window. We can select our own files to analyze.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can import an existing public dataset if we know the dataset accession (\nBrowse Datasets\n). From the Select Input Files popup, you will be a shares files tab. There you will find a box called Import Data Share. In this box you may enter an accession of a MassIVE dataset. Upon clicking import the dataset will appear in your workspace to select input files to analyze from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizing Selected Files into Groups\n\n\nBy default, files can be categorized into separate groups (G1, G2, etc.). For example, case and control or two different microbes can be separate groups. Using the basic options, only six groups can be created. Individual files or entire folders can be selected.\n\n\nClick Finish Selection which will close the pop-up window.\n\n\nParameter Walkthrough\n\n\nBasic Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecursor ion mass tolerance (PIMT)\n\n\nParameter used for MS-Cluster and spectral library search. Specify the precursor ions mass tolerance, in Daltons. This value influences the aforementioned clustering of nearly-identical MS/MS spectra via MS-Cluster. Note that the value of this parameters should be consistent with the capabilities of the mass spectrometer and the specific instrument method used to generated the MS/MS data. Recommended Values value is \u00b1 0.02 Da for high-resolution instruments (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap) and \u00b1 2.0 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ).\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFragment Ion Mass Tolerance (FIMT)\n\n\nParameters used for MS-Cluster, molecular networking, and MS/MS spectral library searches. For every group of MS/MS spectra being considered for clustering (consensus spectrum creation), this value specifies how much fragment ions can be shifted from their expected m/z values. Recommended Values value is \u00b1 0.02 Da for high-resolution instruments (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap) and \u00b1 0.5 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ).\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Network Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMin Pairs Cos\n\n\nMinimum cosine score that must occur between a pair of consensus MS/MS spectra in order for an edge to be formed in the molecular network.\n\n\n0.7\n\n\nLower value will increase the size of the clusters by inducing the clustering of less related MS/MS spectra, higher value will limit do the opposite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum Matched Fragment Ion (Min Matched Peaks)\n\n\nParameters used for molecular networking. Is the minimum number of common fragment ions that are shared by two separate consensus MS/MS spectra in order to be connected by an edge in the molecular network\n\n\n6\n\n\nA low value will permit linkages between spectra of molecules with few similar fragment ions, but it will result in many more less-related spectra being connected to the network. An higher value will do the opposite. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be adjusted depending on the experimental conditions for mass spectra acquisition (such as mode of ionisation, fragmentation conditions, and the mobile phase,  ...), and the collision-induced fragmentation behavior of the molecules of interest within the samples. High molecular weight (MW) compounds, and compounds with more hetero-atoms will generally tend to produce more fragment ions. However, this rule cannot be systematized. For example, some lipids with high MW generate only few fragment ions. Note that spectra with fewer than 5 fragment ions will by default not be considered for networking and result in single nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode TopK\n\n\nMaximum number of neighbor nodes for one single node\n\n\n10\n\n\nThe edge between two nodes are kept only if both nodes are within each other's \u2018TopK\u2019 most similar nodes.  For example, if this value is set at 20, then a single node may be connected to up to 20 other nodes.  Keeping this value low makes very large networks (many nodes) much easier to visualize.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum Cluster Size\n\n\nMinimum number of MS/MS spectra in a consensus MS/MS spectra to be considered for molecular networking\n\n\n2\n\n\nRequires MS-Cluster to be on. This parameter should be tuned based on the dataset size. See presets below\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun MSCluster\n\n\nCluster MS/MS spectra before networking\n\n\nYes\n\n\nMSCluster will analyze every MS/MS spectra resulting from ions that fall within the defined precursor ion mass tolerance, and will merge the nearly-identical MS/MS spectra (above the cosine score) into a single consensus MS/MS spectrum. Each consensus MS/MS spectrum usually consist of multiple MS/MS spectra from across multiple LC-MS runs (or data files)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Connected Component Size\n\n\nMaximum size of nodes allowed in a single connected network\n\n\n100\n\n\nMaximum size of nodes allowed in a single connected network. Nodes within a single connected molecular network will be separated by increasing cosine threshold for that specific connected molecular network. Default value is 100. Use 0 to allow an unlimited number of nodes in a single network. Note that with large datasets, or when a great number of related molecules are in the dataset, this value should be higher (or turn to 0) to retain as much information as possible.

Minimum Matched Fragment Ion (Min Matched Peaks)  Parameters used for molecular networking. Is the minimum number of common fragment ions that are shared by two separate consensus MS/MS spectra in order to be connected by an edge in the molecular network  6  A low value will permit linkages between spectra of molecules with few similar fragment ions, but it will result in many more less-related spectra being connected to the network. An higher value will do the opposite. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be adjusted depending on the experimental conditions for mass spectra acquisition (such as mode of ionisation, fragmentation conditions, and the mobile phase,  ...), and the collision-induced fragmentation behavior of the molecules of interest within the samples. High molecular weight (MW) compounds, and compounds with more hetero-atoms will generally tend to produce more fragment ions. However, this rule cannot be systematized. For example, some lipids with high MW generate only few fragment ions. Note that spectra with fewer than 5 fragment ions will by default not be considered for networking and result in single nodes.

Nodes within a single connected molecular network will be separated by increasing cosine threshold for that specific connected molecular network. Default value is 100. Use 0 to allow an unlimited number of nodes in a single network. Note that with large datasets, or when a great number of related molecules are in the dataset, this value should be higher (or turn to 0) to retain as much information as possible.

By default the nodes are gray, but users can color the nodes based upon spectra counts of the groups they came from. By default the coloring labels will be based upon the default groups G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, and G6. The coloring of each node will be a pie, and the proportion colored of that pie is the proportion of the spectral counts coming from each respective group. Additionally, the Node Coloring legend describes the color for each group. Users can also use their own group names if they defined their own arbitrary groups when creating the network.\n\n\nTo draw the pies, click \"Draw Pies\"\n\n\n\n\nEdge Highlights\n\n\nEdges by default include arrows pointing from low mass spectra to high mass spectra. Further, edges can also be colored. Users are able to enter a delta mz of their choice to highlight in the network. The highlighted edges will appear in red.\n\n\n\n\nEdge Directions\n\n\nThe arrows between nodes in the molecular network point from higher m/z spectra to lower m/z spectra. This can facilitate tracking down identifying multiple extensions of a polymer or extension of a carbon chain.\n\n\nEdge Delta Histogram\n\n\nThis histogram shows the distribution of the edge deltas.\n\n\n\n\nClicking each peak in the histogram allows for highlighting the edges in the network.\n\n\nNode Sizing/Color\n\n\nThe nodes size and color can be adjusted based upon several options:\n\n\n\n\nSpectrum counts\n\n\nPrecursor intensity\n\n\nNumber of Files\n\n\nParent Mass\n\n\nNitrogen Even/Odd\n\n\nPrecursor Charge\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS2 Peak Search in Molecular Network\n\n\nTo search for specific molecules in the molecular network that contain an MS2 fragment of interest, you can enter a product ion m/z you want to find.\n\n\nFirst, we need to grab all the MS/MS spectra into the browser by clicking this button:\n\n\n\n\nThen, we can enter the m/z we want to search for and click the update button. This will highlight which molecules contain the specific product ion.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also see a histogram of all product ions from all MS2 spectra in the current network.\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Interrogation of Network Spectra\n\n\nWhile its great to visualize the network properly, to truly make sense of the network users must be able to interrogate the network metadata and examine the actual spectra. To this end, users are able to find out information about a particular node by simply hovering their mouse over node. This will bring up a hover box describing the node information. At present the display shows like this:\n\n\n\n\nThis shows basic information about the node, as well as the structure if the node is identified by library search and the structure was provided in the library spectrum.\n\n\nTo further investigate the network, users can left click on a node to plot the spectrum in the top right panel (right click to plot in bottom right panel), along with the spectrum information and structure if one is available.\n\n\n\n\nThe spectrum image is interactive so users can zoom in and look at precisely at the spectrum to make sense of the data. Additionally users can compare two spectra in the network by simple right clicking on a different node to render its information in the bottom right panel.\n\n\nUsers can also click on an edge and both nodes that are connected to the edge are automatically displayed in the top and bottom right panels.\n\n\nExamining Spectrum Spectrum Alignment\n\n\nUsers can quickly ascertain how two spectra align to each other at the peak level. By clicking the \"Align Spec\" button to obtain the score between the spectrum in the top and the spectrum in the bottom render panels.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the plots of the spectra will update to reflect the alignments shown here:\n\n\n\n\nwith red peaks representing peaks that match at the exact same masses between the top and bottom spectra, and blue peaks representing peaks matching at shifted masses. Additionally, each peak is labeled with a unique identification number that shows the correspondence of peak matches between the top and bottom spectra.\n\n\nNetwork Spectra Library Matches\n\n\nTo view how exactly a spectrum in the network has matched to a library spectrum, users can click the \"Show Library Match\" in the side panel on the far right. This will bring up this middle panel shown below comparing the spectrum in the network with the library spectrum in green.\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Screen Shot\n\n\n\n\nDownload screenshot of the molecular network.\n\n\nNetwork Layout Re-run\n\n\n\n\nRerun network layout to fit zoom and window.\n\n\nNetwork Window Size\n\n\n\n\nMax network view bigger to see more of the network with more room.\n\n\nPop up Window\n\n\n\n\nPop out network visualizer into new window without top menu bars.\n\n\nSub-Network GraphML for Cytoscape\n\n\n\n\nDownload a GraphML of network and visualize in Cytoscape or other graph software.\n\n\nHide Widgets\n\n\n\n\nShow or hide user interface widgets.\n\n\nView Principle Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) Plots\n\n\nTo view PCoA plots, please enable that output on the input page (default is on) in the \"Advanced Output Options\" section and enabling \"Create Cluster Buckets and BioM/PCoA Plots output\". This will create the appropriate data structures for PCoA analysis. To include additional metadata to color the nodes according to the sample types, include and add additional columns for metadata describing the experiment (see \nmetadata documentation\n).\n\n\nTo view the PCoA plots when the parameters are appropriately set, click the \"View Emporer PCoA Plot in GNPS\" under the section \"Advanced Views - Third Party Visualization\" on the results page of your GNPS job.\n\n\nThis PCoA analysis measures the distance between each of the samples based on their overlapping molecules (by MSCluster).

Note that have the option to import an existing GNPS dataset (by clicking on \"Share Files\") or upload your own data (by clicking on \"Upload Files\"). See the corresponding GNPS documentation for FTP upload.\n\n\nAfter getting done with selecting files, click on Finish Selection.\n\n\nSTEP 4: CONFIGURE\n\n\nConfigure the parameters for the DEREPLICATOR job\n:\nSelect a title for your job, and adjust parameters depending on your data and the mass spectrometer used.\n\n\n\n\nBASIC OPTIONS:\n\n\n-- \nPrecursor Ion Mass Tolerance\n:  This value specifies how much fragment ions can be shifted from their expected m/z values. Default value is \u00b1 0.02 Da for high-resolution instruments (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap) and \u00b1 0.5 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ).\n\n\n-- \nFragment ion Mass Tolerance\n: This value specifies how much fragment ions can be shifted from their expected m/z values. Default value is \u00b1 0.02 Da for high-resolution instruments (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap) and \u00b1 0.5 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ).\n\n\n-- \nSearch analog (VarQuest)\n [RECOMMENDED TO USE]: The VarQuest algorithm can search for analogs of known natural products in MS/MS data using Dereplicator. VarQuest is a modification-tolerant database search tool that discovers unexpected modifications in a blind mode. Since the computational space for variable PNP identification is computationally expensive, VarQuest first constructs a set of feasible PSM using a simple scoring approach and further filters out this set using a rigorous scoring method. Using VarQuest will increase the job time. The use of VarQuest analogs option is recommended as it expands the search space, and it reduces the overall run time.\n\n\nADVANCED OPTIONS:\n\n\n-- \nPNP database\n : a choice of two databases Regular/Extended (Extended one is more informative but 2 times larger, i.e. two times slower processing)\n\n\n-- \nMimimum number of AA\n: Dereplicator is able to search for short peptides. This parameter determines what is the minimum number of amino acids, we consider for the compounds that are considered in Dereplicator search.\n\n\n-- \nAccurate P-values\n : accurate (but slow) algorithm for P-value computation (MS-DPR), by default raw estimation is used.\n\n\n-- \nMax charge\n: Maximum charge allowed.\n\n\nADVANCED DEREPLICATOR OPTIONS:\n\n\n-- \nMax Isotopic Shift\n: When working with molecules with 1000 Da  or higher masses, mass spectrometers commonly predict the precursor mass 1 or 2 Da higher than the monoisotopic mass due to the isotopic pattern. Setting Maximum isotopic shift to higher than 0 allows Dereplicator to consider these shifts in the precursor mass.\n\n\n-- \nAdducts\n : Dereplicator can search in addition to protonated adducts, sodiated and potassium adducts.\n\n\nADVANCED VARQUEST OPTIONS:\n\n\n-- \nMax Allowed Modification Mass\n : Maximum difference allowed between the precursor ion of an unknown modified peptide and the (dereplicated) known peptide.\n\n\n-- \nMin Matched Peaks with Known Compound\n : Minimum number of common peaks between the MS/MS spectrum of an unknown modified peptide and the (dereplicated) known peptide.\n\n\nSelect an email. Then click on submit.\n\n\nYou will soon get an email with the link to the results when your job is finished. You can also check the status of your job in \"Jobs\" section.\n\n\nSTEP 5: VIEW RESULTS\n\n\nSee the DEREPLICATOR job status\n:\n\n\nThe status of the job can be vizualized in your account job list, and through the link in provided in email you will received when the job is done.\n\n\nThe job can be \nCloned\n, for further parameters modifications. Summary Statistics and Workflow Parameters can be consulted on the respective links.\n\n\nClic on \nView Unique Peptides\n (recommended), to have get the list of annotated molecules.\n\n\nClic on the \nView All PSM\n (Peptide-Spectrum Match) to have detailed view of the peptides-to-spectrum matches.\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 6: ANALYSE\n\n\nExplore the DEREPLICATOR annotations:\n\nAnnotations can be sorted using various column (usually the score or the p-value), or a compound name can be searched with the filter function.\n\n\n\n\nClic on \nShow Annotation\n to see the experimental spectrum and the matching with the fragmentation tree of the Dereplicator database.\n\n\n\n\nThe experimental MS/MS spectrum can be viewed in the left panel. The blue peaks are fragment ions that matched the fragmentation tree of peptidic natural products in the database.\n\n\nThe structure of the molecule is displayed on the right.\n\n\nIn the Annotated fragments table, lists the ion fragments that matched with the fragmentation tree, along with their mass error, charge and intensities.\n\n\nClick on a blue peak to highlighted the corresponding fragment on the molecular structure, along with its properties.\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 7: VALIDATE\n\n\nValidate a DEREPLICATOR annotation\n:\nMore than 60% of Dereplicator annotations on GNPS Massive datasets (April 2016) were manually curated and \nresults can be consulted here\n.\n\n\nValidating a DEREPLICATOR annotation (MSI level 1):\n\n\n\n\nA level 1 MSI identification can be achieved of the reference material is available for the compound, by ordering the compound and analyzing it with the same method LC-MS/MS. The MS/MS spectrum and retention time should be identical between the observed and reference MS/MS spectra (co-injection can be done to verify retention time).\n\n\n\n\nAnnotation with the DEREPLICATOR (MSI level 2 or 3), one must:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MS/MS spectrum from the raw file must be inspected (consistency, noise level, ...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe adducts detected must be confirmed using the MS1 spectrum (mono-charged, di-charged ?, protonated adduct ?, ...). This can be done MZmine2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe molecular formula must be verified. \nSirius\n can be used for that (only for single-charged compounds).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain fragment ions non-annotated by the DEREPLICATOR should be manually annotated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the biological source(s) (species) for the peptidic natural product (Google scholar, Dictionnary of Natural Products, AntiMarin, MarinLit, ...), to see if it is consistent with the sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf genome sequence(s) are available, genome mining can be performed to search potential biogenetic gene clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping DEREPLICATOR results on molecular networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun molecular networks with the spectral data (Files format can be mzML/mzXML/MGF). \nSee the following documentation\n. Note that the \nFeature-Based Molecular Network workflow\n can run the \nDEREPLICATOR VarQuest\n automatically (with default parameters only).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the molecular networks clustered data (.MGF file). Click on \nDownload Clustered Spectra as MGF\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpload the .MGF file, and run a DEREPLICATOR job (see present documentation).

The minimum number of common fragment ions that are shared by two separate consensus MS/MS spectra in order to be connected by an edge in the molecular network\n\n\n6\n\n\nA low value will permit linkages between spectra of molecules with few similar fragment ions, but it will result in many more less-related spectra being connected to the network. An higher value will do the opposite. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be adjusted depending on the experimental conditions for mass spectra acquisition (such as mode of ionisation, fragmentation conditions, the mobile phase, etc.), and the collision-induced fragmentation settings of the molecules of interest within the samples. High molecular weight (MW) compounds and compounds with more hetero-atoms generally tend to produce more fragment ions. However, this rule cannot is not absolute. For example, some lipids with high MW generate only a few fragment ions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum shift between precursors\n\n\nThe maximum m/z difference between two precursors permitting their spectra to be considered as direct neighbors in a molecular network\n\n\n500\n\n\nThe maximum mass difference between two connected nodes in a molecular network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork TopK\n\n\nMaximum number of neighbor nodes for one single node\n\n\n10\n\n\nThe edge between two nodes are kept only if both nodes are within each other's \u2018TopK\u2019 most similar nodes.  For example, if this value is set at 20, then a single node may be connected to up to 20 other nodes.  Keeping this value low makes very large networks (many nodes) much easier to visualize.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Connected Component Size\n\n\nMaximum number of nodes allowed in a single connected network\n\n\n100\n\n\nNodes within a single connected molecular network will be separated by increasing cosine threshold for that specific connected molecular network. Default value is 100. Use 0 to allow an unlimited number of nodes in a single network. Note that with large datasets, or when a great number of related molecules are in the dataset, this value should be higher (or turn to 0) to retain as much information as possible. Downstream, these larger networks can be visualized using Cytoscape layout algorithms that can increase the intra-network clustering, allowing to visualize spectral groups in the network despite the number of nodes in the network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Spectral Library Search Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary Search Min Matched Peaks\n\n\nMinimum number of common fragment ions that MS/MS spectra should contain in order to be considered for spectral library annotation. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be tuned depending on the molecules of interest, and the experimental conditions (such as the ionisation mode and the fragmentation conditions).

An higher value will do the opposite. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be adjusted depending on the experimental conditions for mass spectra acquisition (such as mode of ionisation, fragmentation conditions, the mobile phase, etc.), and the collision-induced fragmentation settings of the molecules of interest within the samples. High molecular weight (MW) compounds and compounds with more hetero-atoms generally tend to produce more fragment ions. However, this rule cannot is not absolute.

Import Files\n\n\nGo to Menu: Raw data methods \n Raw data import \n Select the files\n\n\n\n\n2. Mass Detection\n\n\nThis step creates mass lists from your raw data.\n\n\nPerform mass detection on MS level 1: Menu: Raw data methods \n Mass detection \n Set filter : MS level 1\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Set an appropriate intensity threshold. You can use the preview window to assess the right threshold on your data. As a rule of thumb, the value should at least correspond to the minimum value set for the triggering of the MS2 scan event. (Example: MAXIS-QTOF: 1E3, Q-Exactive 1E4)\n\n\nPerform mass detection on MS level 2. The same mass list name must be used.\n\n\nGo to Menu: Raw data methods \n Mass detection \n Set filter : MS level 2.\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\n Make sure to set an intensity threshold representative of noise level in the MS2 spectra. This is typically lower than for MS1. (Example: maXis QTOF: 1E2; LTQ-XL Orbitrap 1E4, Q-Exactive: 0). If you have any doubt, set it to 0.\n\n\n\n\n3. Build Chromatogram (LC-MS feature detection part 1)\n\n\nGo to Menu: Raw data methods / Chromatogram builder\n\n\n4. Deconvolve the Chromatogram (LC-MS feature detection part 2)\n\n\nGo to Menu: Peak list methods \n Peak detection \n Chromatogram deconvolution\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\n tick both options \"m/z range for MS2 scan pairing (Da)\" and \"RT range for MS2 scan pairing (min)\". The values have to be defined according to your experimental setup (expected MS mass accuracy and chromatographic peak width).\n\n\nExample for a UHPLC colum (1.7 \u00b5m C18, 50 \u00d7 2.1 mm, flow rate of 0.5 mL/min):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaXis-QTOF: 12 min gradient, 0.02 Da and 0.15 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ-Exactive: 5 min gradient, 0.01 Da and 0.1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Group isotopes and co-eluting ions\n\n\nUse the \"Isotopic peaks grouper\" [recommended] or other alternative (such as the CAMERA module).\n\n\nGo to Menu: Peak list methods / Isotopes / Isotopic peaks grouper.\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\n  This depends on your expected peak shapes, duty cycle time and the MS mass accuracy. (Example: MAXIS-QTOF, 10 min gradient, 0.1 min, 0.02 m/z; Q-Exactive, 5 min gradient, 0.05 min, 0.01 m/z)\n\n\n6. Order the peaklists\n\n\nGo to Menu: Peak list methods \n Order peak lists.\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\n This is to ensure the reproducibility of the processing Indeed, the aligned peak list will change slighlty if that step is not performed. \n\n\n7. LC-MS feature alignement (Peaklist alignement)\n\n\nIn this step, the peak lists from each sample will be aligned in one aligned peak list. The alignement is performed iteratively using the first peak list selected (see MZmine documentation). For that reason, make sure the first sample is adapted (not a negative control) or to manually put an representative peaklist in the first position.\n\n\nGo to Menu: Peak list methods \n Alignment \n Join aligner\n\n\n8. Detect Missing Peaks / Gap Filling (Optional)\n\n\nGap filling enables to retrieve the intensity of a peak in all the samples, even if it was not detected in a previous processing step.\nGo to Menu: Peak list methods / Gap filling / Peak finder (multi-threaded).\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\n This step is optional. Use the multi-threaded peak finder for fast processing.\n\n\n9. Filter the Peaklist to MS/MS Peaks (Optional)\n\n\nDepending on the number of features in the aligned peaklist, it is possible to filter the peaklist to keep only features with minimum number of occurences (\"Minimum peaks in a row\") or a mininum number of isotopic peaks for the feature (\"Minimum peaks in an isotope pattern\"), or to \"Keep only peaks with MS2 scan (GNPS)\".\n\n\nGo to Menu: Peak list methods \n Filtering \n Peak list row filter \n Select the filters\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\n if you use a filter, we recommend using the filter \"Reset the peak number ID\"\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Note that this step was mandatory in the previous version of FBMN with MZmine2, now the filter \"Keep only peaks with MS2 scan (GNPS)\" is optional.\n\n\n\n\n10. Use the GNPS Export module\n\n\nUse the dedicated module \"Submit to/Export for GNPS\" in MZmine to export the needed file:\n\n\n\n\n\n\na \nfeature quantification table\n with LC-MS feature intensities (.CSV file format)\n\n\n\n\n\n\na \nMS/MS spectral summary file\n, with a representative MS/MS spectrum per LC-MS feature. List of the MS/MS spectra (.MGF file format) (the most intense MS/MS per feature is selected).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the last \"filtered aligned peaklist\" and Go to Menu: Peak list methods \n Export \n Export for/Submit to GNPS\n\n\n\n\nSee an example of files generated by the export module using the workflow:\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nThe files can be uploaded to the GNPS web-platform and Feature-Based Molecular Networking job can be directly launched\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\n While the possibility to submit the files directly to GNPS and launch a FBMN job on the fly is really convenient for quick data analysis, the job and files will not be saved in your personal account on GNPS if you do not provide username/password, and you are limited to basic presets of parameters. For that reason, we recommend to upload your files with the FTP uploader \n(see documentation)\n and prepare your job \ndirectly on GNPS\n (you must be logged in first), or alternatively to clone the submitted job.\n\n\n\n\nIn the \"Export for/Submit to GNPS\" module, select the option: \"Submit to GNPS\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Metadata file: specify the path to the metadata table in GNPS format. [See documentation here] (networking.md/#metadata)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the parameters presets for the GNPS job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail: specify the email to forward the job link\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotation edges (Experimental): that option can be ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen website: if ticked, will open the job webpage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES: The feature table must contain at least the row ID, the row m/z, and row retention time, along with the sample columns. It is currently mandatory for the sample name headers to have the following format: \"filename Peak area\". Depending on the steps used in MZmine the sample name header can be \"filename baseline-corrected Peak area\", but this has to be changed back to \"filename Peak area\".\n\n\nVideo Tutorial - Quick MZMine2 Export to GNPS for FBMN.\n\n\nThe workflow for Feature Based Molecular Networking in GNPS is different from the classic molecular networking workflow. \nAccess the FBMN workflow here\n (You need to be logged in first !)\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFeature Based Molecular Networking in GNPS\n\n\nThe main documentation of the Feature Based Molecular Networking workflow on GNPS \ncan be consulted on that page\n.

For convenience we also provide a batch file (XML format) that can be imported directly in MS-DIAL.\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\n MS-DIAL parameters will vary depending on the mass spectrometer, the acquisition parameters, and the sample studied.

Make a New Project\n\n\nGo to Menu: File / New Project\n\n\n\n\nSelect appropriate parameters (ionization type / method type / data type / ion mode / target omics) for your dataset.\n\n\nClick \u201cNext\u201d.\n\n\n2. Import Files\n\n\nClick \u201cbrowse\u201d and open the dropdown menu for file types, and select \u201cmzML file(*.mzml)\u201d. The other available options are .abf or .cdf files.\n\n\n[Note] Data files should be placed at the same folder with the project file.\n\n\nSelect files and click \u201cOpen\u201d. You will see the list of selected files.\n\n\nClick \u201cNext\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n3. Set Parameters - Data Collection\n\n\nSet the MS1/MS2 tolerance and data collection parameters.\n\n\nIf you are dealing with a large dataset, you can reduce the running time by setting multithreading option in the \u201cAdvanced\u201d menu.\n\n\n\n\n4. Set Parameters - Peak Detection\n\n\nSet the MS1 peak detection parameters. You should set a appropriate peak height threshold.\n\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the value should at least correspond to the minimum value set for the triggering of the MS2 scan event.\n\n\nIf you want to remove some specific ions (e.g. known contaminants), you can make an exclusion list here.\n\n\n\n\n5. Set Parameters - MS2Deconvolution\n\n\nYou should set an appropriate MS/MS abundance cutoff. Make sure to set an intensity threshold representative of the noise level in MS2 spectra.\n\n\nThis is typically lower than for MS1. If you have any doubt, set it to 0.\n\n\n\n\n6. Set Parameters - Alignment\n\n\nSet appropriate Retention time / MS1 tolerance for alignment.\n\n\nIf you have any quality control (QC) sample data, it is a nice candidate to be the reference file.\n\n\nClick \u201cFinish\u201d, then MS-DIAL will perform all the feature finding process.\n\n\n\n\nExport or/and submit the files needed for Feature-Based Molecular Networking on GNPS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\na \nfeature quantification table\n with ion intensities (.CSV file format)\n\n\n\n\n\n\na list of the MS/MS spectra (MS/MS spectral summary file in .MGF format) (the most intense MS/MS per feature is selected).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu: Export / Alignment result\n\n\n\n\nCheck the \u201cGNPS export\u201d box, and set the spectra type to \u201ccentroid\u201d.\n\n\nSet the directory and file name, then click \u201cExport\u201d.

Alternatively, you can upload your OpenMS TOPP tool \nparameter file\n (.INI files).

Several modes for the generation of the \nconsensus MS/MS spectrum\n are available and described below. Note that these parameters are defined in the GNPSExport parameters file (.INI file, \navailable with that link\n).\n\n\nUsage and Options for GNPSExport TOPP tool:\n\n\nGNPSExport --help\n\n\nGNPSExport -ini iniFile-GNPSExport.ini\n           -in_cm filefilter.consensusXML\n           -in_mzml inputFile0.mzML inputFile1.mzML\n           -out GNPSExport_output.mgf\n\n\n\n\nOptions for the consensus MS/MS spectra: \noutput_type\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerge [RECOMMENDED]\n: \nmerged_spectra\n - For each \nconsensusElement\n, the GNPSExport will merge all eligible MS/MS scans into one representative \nconsensus MS/MS spectrum\n. Eligible MS/MS scans have a pairwise \ncosine similarity\n with the MS/MS scan of highest precursor intensity above the \nCosine Similarity Treshold\n. The fragment ions of merged MS/MS scans are binned in m/z (or Da) range defined by the \nBinning width\n parameter.\n\n\n\n\nCosine Similarity Treshold\n: \nmerged_spectra:cos_similarity\n (float, default: 0.9) - Parameter that defines \nCosine Similarity Treshold\n for the pairwise \ncosine similarity\n between the MS/MS scan with the highest precursor intensity and the other MS/MS scans.\n\n\nBinning width\n: \nmerged_spectra:ms2_binned_size\n (float, default: 0.02 Daltons) -  Parameter that defines the \nBinning width\n of fragment ions during the merging of eligible MS/MS spectra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost intense\n: \nmost_intense\n - For each \nconsensusElement\n, the GNPSExport will output the \nmost intense\n MS/MS scan (with the highest precursor ion intensity) as \nconsensus MS/MS spectrum\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll MS/MS\n: \nfull_spectra\n - For each \nconsensusElement\n, the GNPSExport will output \nAll MS/MS scans\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that \nmass accuracy\n and the \nretention time window\n for the pairing between MS/MS scans and a LC-MS feature orconsensusElement is defined at the \nIDMapper tool\n step.\n\n\nRunning the FBMN workflow with OpenMS files\n\n\nAfter the processing with OpenMS, the output files can be used to run the Feature-Based Molecular Networking workflow on GNPS either using the [Superquick FBMN start page] (http://dorresteinappshub.ucsd.edu:5050/featurebasednetworking) or \nthe standard interface of the FBMN workflow\n (you need to be logged in GNPS first).\n\n\nMake sure to select the correct table source (OpenMS).\n\n\nThe main documentation for FBMN \ncan be accessed here\n.\n\n\nPage contributors\n\n\nLouis Felix Nothias (UCSD), Abinesh Sarvepalli (UCSD), Ivan Protsyuk (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany).\n\n\nContribute to the Documentation\n\n\n\n\nFor informations/feature request, please open an \"Issue\" on the \nCCMS-UCSD/GNPSDocumentation\n GitHub repository.\n\n\nTo contribute directly to the GNPS documentation, fork the \nCCMS-UCSD/GNPSDocumentation\n repository, and make a \"Pull Request\".",

            "text": "Introduction to FBMN\n\n\nFeature-Based Molecular Networking\n (FBMN) is a computational method that bridges popular mass spectrometry data processing tools for LC-MS/MS and molecular networking analysis on \nGNPS\n. The tools supported are: \nMZmine2\n, \nOpenMS\n, \nMS-DIAL\n, \nMetaboScape\n, \nXCMS\n, and \nProgenesis QI\n.\n\n\nThe main documentation for Feature-Based Molecular Networking \ncan be accessed here:\n\n\nThe documentation for Feature-Based Molecular Networking using Cytoscape is provided below.\n\n\nFeature-Based Molecular Networking in Cytoscape\n\n\nCytoscape is an open source software platform used to visualize, analyze and annotate molecular networks from GNPS. Cytoscape is available for download from \nhere\n. The instructions were created with Cytoscape 3.7.\n\n\nShannon, P., et al. (2003). Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks. \nGenome Res, 13\n(11), 2498-2504. \ndoi:10.1101/gr.1239303\n\n\nDownloading Cytoscape Files from GNPS\n\n\nThe first step is to download the input file (.graphML file format) for import into Cytoscape. From the job status page in the Feature-Based Molecular Networking workflow, click on \nDownload Cytoscape Data\n. Save and unzip the downloaded file.  \n\n\n\n\nUnzip the file and the resulting folder will look like this:\n\n\n\n\nImporting Files from GNPS to Cytoscape\n\n\nTo import the network file into Cytoscape:\n\n    in Cytoscape click on \nImport Network from File System\n and then choose the \n.graphml\n file. \n\n   Alternatively, you can drag and drop the .graphml file into Cytoscape.\n\n\nThe imported network will be displayed in the main window. In the \nControl Panel\n (left panel), in the \nNetwork\n tab, rename the network with right-click and select \nRename Network\n.\n\n\n\n\nYou can import the table file into Cytoscape. Click \nImport Table from File System\n, navigate to the \u201cDB_result\u201d folder and select the .csv file. Lastly, click OK in the opened window.\n\n\n\n\nRotation of the Network\n\n\nTo rotate the entire molecular network choose the \nLayout\n tab and click \nNode Layout tool\n. In the opened window, uncheck the \nSelected Only\n box to rotate the entire network and move the blue bar to 90. You can also select specific subnetworks and rotate them by checking \nSelected only\n.\n\n\n\n\nTable Panel Visualization Data\n\n\nFor advanced network visualisation and data analysis, you may click on \nTable Panel\n and select node or edge column information (network metadata) to be displayed. For example,  in the \nNode Table\n, you can select the \n\"Compound_name\"\n (name of the spectral library match), the \"\nparent mass\"\n (precursor ion mass), the \"\nRTconsensus\"\n (retention time for the node), \"\nMZErrorPPM\"\n (ppm error with the spectral library match) and any attributes of interest in your in \nNode Table\n (node metadata).\n\n\n\n\nCreate a New Style\n\n\nA style can be created by clicking on \nCreate New Style\n and a style name can be specified (e.g. \"High vs Low Plant Consumer\"). The created style can be exported by going in the main menu to \nFile\n \n \nExport\n \n \nStyles to File\n, or a previous style can be imported by clicking on \nImport\n \n \nStyle From File\n in the \nFile\n menu. \n\n\n\n\nEdit the Style\n\n\nNode Styling\n\n\nLabel\n\n\nIn the  \nControl Panel\n (left panel), go to the \nStyle\n tab. Within the \nNode\n sub-tab, the properties of the node style can be modified. For example, you can choose the \nprecursor mass\n as node label for the molecular networks [you need to select  \nPassthrough Mapping\n as the \nMapping Type\n]. Go to \nProperties\n to display more style properties. \n\n\n\n\nSize\n\n\nIn order to match the label size to the node size, go into \nStyle panel\n, at \nLabel Front Size\n option, select \u201c\nSumPeakIntensity\n\u201d or the \u201c\nnumber of spectra\n\u201d (as selected for node size) as \nColumn and Continuous Mapping\n as \nMapping Type\n. As described above, begin by setting the value for minimum and maximum node size value with the button Set Min and Max, then choose the same continuous mapping as used for the node size.\n\n\n\n\nPie charts\n\n\nIf you used a metadata table, the node table will contain group columns for each group specified in the metadata table. The group columns starts with \"_GNPSGROUP__\" and will consist of the mean (default and recommended) or summed intensity of the ion across the group's samples based on the MS1 feature table (LC-MS peak area). This group columns can be used to visualize groups as pie charts in the network.\n\n\nTo start visualizing pie charts on node for the groups, click on the left box (\nDef\n column) for the \nImage/Chart1\n node property. Choose the \nCharts\n tab and select the \nPie Chart Icon\n. Now, in the \nData\n sub-tab, select the group columns you are interested in visualizing in the \nSelect Columns\n box (e.g. \n\"GNPSGROUP: Less_than 5\"\n (low plant consumers) and \n\"GNPSGROUP:More_than_30\"\n (high plant consumers)). Click on \nOptions\n (under \nData\n) to choose colors for the Groups (groups are numbered based on their position in the \nSelected Columns\n box). Click \nApply\n when you are done with your selection.\n\n\n\n\nEdge Styling\n\n\nWidth\n\n\nTo aid in the visualization of individual node similarities within a cluster, the cosine score is displayed as an edge. The cosine scores define similarity between two MS/MS spectra. Scores ranging from 0 (totally dissimilar) to 1 (identical). The edge thickness can be used to visualize the cosine score value between related nodes. For this we will use the cosine-score-based continuous mapping for the edge thickness. Go to the \nStyle\n tab, and the \nEdge\n sub-tab. From the \nWidth\n property drop down menu, select \n\"cosine_score\"\n for the \nColumn\n and \nContinuous Mapping\n for the \nMapping Type\n. Double click on the \nContinuous Mapping\n area of the menu to adjust the thickness of the edge. Click OK to apply the setting changes. Optimise the minimum and maximum value for the continuous mapping.\n\n\n\n\nMining information in the network\n\n\nSub-network creation\n\n\nTo separate one or multilple specific desired network(s), press \u201cctrl\u201d or \u201ccommand\u201d (windows or MacOS, respectively) at the same time drag the mouse to select the network(s). Then, click on the symbol as shown below. Automatically, the sub-network is created. For going back to the main network, go into the \nControl Panel\n, select \nNetwork\n and then choose the main network.\n\n\n\n\nThe Toolbar function\n\n\nThe Cytoscape's toolbar can be used to search nodes or edge metadata (e.g., \n\"shared name\"\n). Note that this feature is very slow, especially with large networks. The list of nodes in the Note Table will be updated. You can select nodes of interest, perform right-click for \nSelect nodes\n and then click on the \n+ magnifier\n in the main menu to perform a zoom on the selected node.\n\n\n\n\nThe Select function\n\n\nThe Select function can be used to create a selection of nodes and/or edges based on their metadata and/or network topology. Go to the \nControl Panel\n and click on \nSelect\n tab. Then, click on the \"\n+\n\" button and choose between column, degree, or topology filter(s) to add different filter properties. The \"\nx\n\" button deletes the corresponding property. For each filter property, various options are provided depending on the column type (numeric column:  \nis\n, \nis not\n, \nbetween\n; for string column: \ncontains\n and \ndoes not contain\n. Here, we create \nannotation filter\n that selects nodes by the spectral library match with 10 ppm maximum error between precursor ions (\"\nMZErrorPPM\n\" from 0 to 10). By default, the filter should be automatically applied to the network, otherwise click \nApply\n. Under the Filter tab, the number of nodes meeting the filter property variables (here 160 nodes) will be selected. These nodes are automatically selected and highlighted in yellow in the network.\n\n\nFilters are very powerful network analysis tools that can be modified, saved and exported. To rename, remove, create a new filter, or other options, click on the right button beside the Filter list menu. The list of available Filters will appear in the top part of the panel. \n\n\nFor more details and options, follow this \nlink\n. \n\n\n\n\nBypass mode for style property\n\n\nA bypass could be applied to selected nodes and/or edged by going into the \nStyle\n panel, and clicking on the \nByp.\n column for the property you want to change such as \nBorder paint\n and \nBorder Width\n. For modifying or removing the bypass property, select the nodes of interest, click right and choose \nRemove Bypass\n or \nset Bypass\n option. \n\n\n\n\nDrawing structure in nodes\n\n\nThe chemical structures can be visualized in the node using chemViz2 bioinformatics plugin for Cytoscape (\nhttp://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/cytoscape/chemViz/\n). First, the chemViz2 plugin has to be installed. To do that, go to the \nApps\n tab in the main menu, then open \nApp Manager\n. In the \nInstall Apps\n tab click on \nchemViz2\n and install it by clicking \nInstall\n. For more information about chemViz2, refer to the information available on the \nchemViz2 website\n. \n\n\n\n\nOnce installed, chemViz2 can be used to display chemical structures on nodes. First, you will have to verify that chemViz2 is properly parameterized. Select \nApps\n in the main menu, go to \nCheminformatics Tools\n and click \nSettings\n. In the \nAttribute Settings\n section, choose \nnode.Smiles\n for \nSMILES Attribute\n and/or \nnode.INCHI\n for \nInCHI Attribute\n. Apply it by clicking \nOK\n. \n\n\n\n\nFinally, to draw structures in the nodes, return to \nApps\n \n \nCheminformatics Tools\n \n \nPaint Structures\n and select \non all nodes\n or \non selected nodes\n. Visualize the results. If needed, create a dedicated style to facilitate structure visualization. \n\n\n\n\nVideo Tutorial FBMN and Cytoscape\n\n\nOur \ntutorial on running the FBMN analysis on GNPS including a Cytoscape demo\n.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSee our \ntutorial on using MZmine2\n for the FBMN analysis of a cohort from the [American Gut Project] (http://humanfoodproject.com/americangut/).\n\n\nPage contributors\n\n\nMelissa Esposito (UCSD), Irina Koester (SIO, UCSD), Christian Martin (INDICASAT), Louis Felix Nothias (UCSD), Ivan Protsyuk (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany).\n\n\nContribute to the Documentation\n\n\n\n\nFor informations/feature request, please open an \"Issue\" on the \nCCMS-UCSD/GNPSDocumentation\n GitHub repository.\n\n\nTo contribute directly to the GNPS documentation, fork the \nCCMS-UCSD/GNPSDocumentation\n repository, and make a \"Pull Request\".",

Mass2Motifs are fragmentation patterns of often co-occurring mass fragment peaks and/or neutral losses that often represent molecular substructures. Check out the \nMS2LDA website\n here where you can find more information, browse through data sets, and sign up for an account to run the Mass2Motif discovery on your own data. At GNPS, we are working with the MS2LDA team to integrate both workflows which allows users to map Mass2Motif occurrences in their Molecular Families.\n\n\nIt is now also possible to run MS2LDA analyses through the GNPS interface \nhere\n which will lead to the below displayed job entry page.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, it is explained what input files are needed, how the parameters can be chosen, and what kind of output you get.\nFinally, it is explained how the obtained MS2LDA model can be further explored on the \nMS2LDA\n website by uploading the generated dict file.\n\n\nCollecting the right input files\n\n\nAfter providing the GNPS analysis with a title, the right input files are needed to start an MS2LDA analysis. They can be obtained with the classical molecular network (MS-Cluster based, \nsee documentation here\n) or from the Feature-Based Molecular Networking workflow (using for example MZmine2, \nsee documentation here\n. These files are:\n\n\n\n\nRequired: Spectral data (MGF file) which can be downloaded from a processed Molecular Networking job\n\n\nRequired: Edges file including selfloops which can be downloaded from a processed Molecular Networking job (i.e., typically found in the networkedges_selfloop folder within the downloaded GNPS job folder)\n\n\nOptional: MS1 peak abundance information (CSV file generated by MZmine2). The format must be similar to the MZmine2 format used with the \nFeature based Molecular Networking\n. This will allow you to perform MS1 differential analysis within the MS2LDA web app to find discriminate Mass2Motifs between groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting the input files, the right MGF Source needs to be selected: \"MSCluster\" for a classical Molecular Networking derived clustered MGF file, and \"MZmine2\" for a Feature based Molecular Networking derived MGF file.\n\n\nQuick start from processed Molecular Network\n\n\nTo facilitate MS2LDA analysis of processed Molecular Networking jobs, in the newest (V2) version and the Feature Based Molecular Networking job, under \"Advanced Views - Experimental Views\" there is a button \nAnalyze with MS2LDA\n that will bring you directly to the MS2LDA analysis page prefilling the relevant input files (spectral MGF file and edge pair file including selfloops). See also the animated GIF below.\nPlease note that you can adapt the title and you must check the relevant MS2LDA parameter settings for your data set.\n\n\n\n\nSetting the MS2LDA parameters\n\n\nThere are three sections of parameters to fill out of which the first is the most important. Default values are provided for all settings, but each of them is dependent on the input data. We provide some guidelines here to ease your choice.\n\n\nLDA parameters\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Advanced MS2LDA parameters\" displays four parameter values to set. The first is the bin width used to bin the MS2 fragments and losses. Defaults for Q-Exactive (0.005 Da) and ToF (0.01 Da) Data are provided. For instruments like Ion Traps a larger bin width of 0.1 Da is recommended. The appropriate bin width to choose is dependent on the expected mass variation of mass fragments across mass spectra in your data.\n\n\n\n\nThe number of LDA iterations is set to 1000 by default which should work in most cases.\n\n\nThe Minimum MS2 Intensity is meant to filter out the basic noise from the MS/MS spectra. It is recommended to open the inputted MGF file and check the noise levels. Typically they range from 25-200 (ToF Data) to 5000 (Q-Exactive Data). Inclusion of noise will unnecessarily lengten the analysis time and create non-informative Mass2Motifs.\n\n\nThe LDA Free Motifs correspond to the number of \"free Mass2Motifs\" that are added on top of the prefixed annotated Mass2Motifs from MotifDB. This number depends on your data: if you input a larger number of fragmented molecules (i.e., \n 4,000) that includes lots of novel chemistry not present in MotifDB it is best to put the LDA Free Motifs on 300 - 500. If the data set is relatively small with a considerable amount of known chemistry, you best put this number to 50 - 150.\n\n\nSelecting MotifDB motif sets\n\n\nBy default all Motif Sets will be imported from \nMotifDB\n. However, it is wise to exclude annotated motif sets of sources that are very distant from the source of your input data. Note that the GNPS and MassBank are annotated Mass2Motifs discovered in reference molecules.\n\n\n\n\nOutput Networking file thresholds\n\n\nAfter running MS2LDA, output files are created that include a new networking (edge) file that can be used to create an enriched Molecular Network including Mass2Motif distributions through the Molecular Families. To do so, cut-off values (thresholds) are needed for LDA scores to consider a Mass2Motif to be linked to a molecule or not and how many you want to show in the network. Default values are provided that were found to work well so far.\nIn \nthis\n publication the two scores are explained: probability and overlap score.\n\n\n\n\nNote that you will have to provide your email address in the appropriate field in order to be notified upon completion of your GNPS-MS2LDA job.\n\n\nMS2LDA output files\n\n\nUpon succesful completion, you will be able to see the output job page as displayed below:\n\n\n\n\nThere are different views and files for download available:\n\n\nView Motif Labels for Spectra\n\n\nThis view displays all the fragmented molecules (scans) and each of the motifs linked to them [above the set thresholds as specified in the Output Networking file thresholds].\nIt can be downloaded as a tab separated file.\n\n\n\n\nIndividual Motif Details\n\n\nThis view displays all molecule-motif links [some molecules have more than one motif linked and will appear multiple times in this table] and also shows the annotation if available from MotifDB.\nIt can be downloaded as a tab separated file.\n\n\n\n\nView Pairs with Motif Edges\n\n\nThis view is the new edge file enriched with Motif interactions: note that in the \"Interact\" column apart from cosine now different Mass2Motifs are listed [above the set thresholds as specified in the Output Networking file thresholds].\nIt can be downloaded as a tab separated file - this can be used to create a new enriched Molecular Network in CytoScape.\n\n\n\n\nView Motif PDF\n\n\nThis displays a PDF report of all the Mass2Motifs. Each Mass2Motif spans two pages with the first page a graphical overview of the relevant mass fragments (red, on top, pointing up) and neutral losses (green, bottom, pointing down) with the y-axis being the intensity which equals the features' probability to be found in the Mass2Motif, and the x-axis being the m/z (rounded up to nominal values in the labels) in Daltons.\nThe second page displays the top mass fragments and neutral losses with their probabilities.\n\n\nDownload Motif PDF\n\n\nThis downloads the PDF report as explained in \"View Motif PDF\".\n\n\nDownload Pairs\n\n\nThis downloads the new edge file as explained in \"View Pairs with Motif Edges\".\n\n\nDownload MS2LDA Dict\n\n\nThis downloads the MS2LDA Dict file that houses all the relevant information on the MS2LDA experiment.\n\n\nAnalysing the MS2LDA results within GNPS\n\n\nThe different available views enable a quick overview of the MS2LDA experiment. Especially when annotated Mass2Motifs are found, this could help in further downstream analysis.\nHowever, when no annotation is provided, the Mass2Motif is one of the \"free Motifs\" that was discovered by LDA. With the MS2LDA Dict file through the MS2LDA web app there are ways to analyse these Mass2Motifs further and also annotate them.\n\n\nIn general, when analysing annotating or novel Mass2Motifs, it is important to keep \nthis\n in mind!\n\n\nTaking the GNPS results into the MS2LDA web app\n\n\nAfter downloading the MS2LSA Dict file from the finished MS2LDA experiment, this can be uploaded into the \nMS2LDA web app\n. There is a \nUser Guide\n available that covers the main functionalities of the MS2LDA web app.\n\n\nIf it is your first time at the MS2LDA web app, make sure you get a login account before continuing. Once logged in, go to the experiments section:\n\n\n\n\nBy default, you arrive on the Create tab which lets you create an MS2LDA experiment from mass spectrometry data.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the Upload tab, to continue:\n\n\n\n\nNow, you will have to provide a unique name for the MS2LDA experiment and you can also provide relevant details.\nMost importantly, you will need to select the location of the downloaded MS2LDA Dict file under \"LDA output file\".\nAlso, you will need to select the bin width as used in the GNPS-MS2LDA workflow (\"Bin Width\") from the available options.\n\n\n\n\nAfter you are ready, you can click \"Upload Your Experiment\" and the upload will start.\n\n\nAnnotating new motifs\n\n\nOnce the MS2LDA dict file finished uploading, you can browse the MS2LDA experiment in the web app like a regular MS2LDa experiment. If you click on the experiment name, multiple tabs will appear:\n\n\n\n\nHere, you can click on the Summary Page tab which leads you to the summary of the experiment that includes all relevant Tables. For example, the Motif Table can be browsed, sorted, searched, and downloaded as CSV:\n\n\n\n\nWhen clicking on the relevant \"free Motif\" name a Motif Page will appear where the relevant mass fragment and neutral losses are listed including their scores and a frequency plot. Also, all the spectra the Mass2Motif appears in can be browsed to analyse the nature of the fragmentation pattern.\nImportantly, if you can annote the motif with any structural information, this can be provided on top of the page with the Annotation field for the full annotation and the Short Annotation field for a label to display in graphics - make sure to save the Motif Page afterwards! After reloading the Summary Page or the Show Mass2Motif tabs, the annotation(s) will be displayed and are searchable.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, on top of the summary page there is a toggle where you can make the entire MS2LDA experiment public. See for example the public \nMassBank Experiment\n.\n\n\nMS1 Differential Analyses within the MS2LDA web app\n\n\nIf the Feature based Molecular Networking workflow was used, the MS1 peak information is available in the MS2LDA Dict file. This can be used to create MS1 analysis to find Mass2Motif that are discriminative between two sample groups.\nMore information can be found in \nthis\n publication and the \nMS2LDA web app User Guide\n explains how to set up such an analysis within your experiment.\n\n\nUploading annotated motif sets into MotifDB\n\n\nThis is a future feature that will become available in the course of this year. It will allow you to make your new annotations searchable and usable by the community.\n\n\nFuture Directions\n\n\nAt GNPS, we are working with the MS2LDA team to promote publication of curated sets of Mass2Motifs into \nMotifDB\n that can help to annotate your MS/MS spectra.\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nHave you found MS2LDA to be useful for your data analysis?

The web interface provides a quick and easy way to perform initial analysis of your data, particularly if you are interested in a specific structure or class of structures and want to inspect in the results.\n\n\nTo have access to the web interface click on the 'EXPERIMENTAL - NAPviewer' at the results page: \n\n\n\n\nThe result summaries can be divided in four sections.\n\n\n1. Structure view\n\n\nNAP attempts to re-rank the candidate structures provided by \nMetFrag\n using the information provided by the molecular network. This first view shows the \nS\ntructures ranked by MetFrag and the ones re-ranked by NAP to allow the user to quickly inspect if the propagation improved the ranking:\n\n\n\n\n2. Graph view\n\n\nAs the re-ranking is performing obtaining information from neighbor nodes, the \nG\nraph view displays the direct neighbor's first candidate structures of a given re-ranked node to allow the user to inspect if the re-ranking is consistent in the network:\n\n\n\n\nThe node border colors indicate the source of structure: green - reference spectral library structure; magenta MetFrag's first candidate; blue Fusion's first candidate and red Consensus' first candidate.\n\n\n3. Fragment view\n\n\nSome important aspects of structural prediction are: how many fragments were predicted, which fragments and which substructures were assigned to the predictions. The \nF\nragment view displays the direct fragments predicted for each structure in the candidate list of a given fragmentation spectrum (represented by a node in the network):\n\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse over the candidate fragment it is possible to see the substructure predicted for the fragment.\n\n\n4. Full candidate list view\n\n\nAs structural prediction is very challenging. The correct candidate may not be the first in the list, therefore it is important to be able to browse the candidate list. The \nLink\n containing the full list of candidate structures found in NAP search is provided. The first column of the candidate's table contains a link out for the respective database where the structure was originated. The table also contains the ranking for MetFrag, Fusion and Consensus, the link for number of fragments predicted for each candidate structure, a link to fragment plot representation and a column with color coded structural similarity grouping that can be easily associated with candidate's \nClassyFire\n class, when available:\n\n\n\n\nNAP Visualization in Cytoscape\n\n\nIn a similar way as \nMolecular Networking\n uses \nCytoscape\n to visualize the whole network, we can visualize structure prediction of entire connected component or networks using the output from NAP.\n\n\nCytoscape (we have used version \n= 3.4) is available for download from \nhere\n. \n\n\nDownload NAP Cytoscape files\n\n\nTo download NAP's Cytoscape file, go back to the results page of your task:\n\n\n\n\nand download the compacted file containing the 'structure_graph_alt.xgmml' file.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the download, remember to uncompress the file for downstream use.\n\n\nInstalling the ChemViz plugin\n\n\nTo visualize the structures on NAP output we need the \nChemViz\n plugin. The easiest way to install it is using Cytoscape's App Manager, as shown below:\n\n\n\n\nLoad NAP Cytoscape file and apply layout\n\n\nLoad the 'structure_graph_alt.xgmml' file:\n\n\n\n\nand apply a layout to spread the nodes:\n\n\n\n\nChange image display properties and paint library match structure\n\n\nThe 'structure_graph_alt.xgmml' file contains some pre-set elements to aid structure display. Nodes possessing a structure are empty squares. Node borders are either green (spectral library match) or blue (in silico prediction). In silico predictions can be a combination of MetFrag, Fusion and Consensus. Browsing the 'Table Panel' is possible to inspect which scoring method has structures available in the columns MetFrag/Fusion/ConsensusSMILES. To use one of these columns to display the structures we have first to change the properties of ChemViz, by doing:\n\n\n\n\nAfter setting the desired source column to display the structure one can just 'paint' the structure on the node:\n\n\n\n\nChange display properties and paint on multiple nodes\n\n\nAs we described in the publications \nbelow\n we have a decreasing order of confidence on structural prediction spectral library match \n Fusion scoring \n Consensus scoring \n MetFrag scoring. To change for Fusion scoring structures you can do:\n\n\n\n\nand paint the structures:\n\n\n\n\nDisplay the list of candidates\n\n\nAs discussed in the \nOnline Exploration\n section, the most correct structure may not be the first candidate. Therefore we can display the structures outputted from our \ninitial parameters\n:\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\nda Silva, Ricardo R., Mingxun Wang, Louis-F\u00e9lix Nothias, Justin JJ van der Hooft, Andr\u00e9s Mauricio Caraballo-Rodr\u00edguez, Evan Fox, Marcy J.

Click on \"View Network\" for any of the Stenothricin compounds:   Here we can see the molecular network of related compounds to Stenothricin   To color the nodes by which species they came from, click the draw pies   We can now see all the compounds from S. roseosporus in red and Streptomyces sp. DSM5940 in blue.  Further, we can highlight the compounds where are identified (blue border of nodes) and show the actual names   This network indicates to us that there are some unique compounds being produced by Streptomyces sp. DSM5940 that are related to Stenothricin.  To highlight what might be different about these molecules, we can highlight the mass differences between connected (structurally related) molecules in the network.   We can see the Stenothricin-GNPS 2 is a molecule which we discovered using molecular networking. We can further interrogate the similarity at the fragmentation level by clicking the edge between the two nodes to visualize the MS/MS spectra and align the peaks",
