Traditionally, after manuscript publication, mass spectrometry datasets remain static and are never heard from again, silo'd in data cemeteries. GNPS' approach is different, we aim to Automatically make new discoveries within each dataset Aid future analyses by putting new data in the context of all previously existing datasets GNPS achieves the first goal by periodically reanalyzing each and every public dataset. With ever expanding reference spectral libraries, GNPS makes new identifications within datasets in an automatic fashion, recording this growth in identifications, and reports it back to the community. GNPS achieves the second goal by enabling users to \"BLAST\" MS/MS spectra against the entire GNPS set of datasets (see MASST Search ). Exploring Current Continuous Identifications On each dataset page (See datasets ) the list of all continuous identifcations is listed under the \"Continuous Identification\" section. This list of all analyses shows the growth of identifications over time as well as how the identifications changed over time. For example, the 3D molecular skin cartography dataset (See MSV000078556 ) grew from 94 (April 9, 2014) identifications in the initial continuous identification to 860 (June 1, 2018). Dataset Subscriptions Whenever new identifications are made in a dataset, subscribers are automatically notified via email. To be subscribed to a dataset of interest, click the subscribe button on the dataset page: Continuous Identification Ratings Help us improve Continuous Identification by rating the matches returned on the \"All Identifications Page\". For each identification made, please rate each match according to the following rubric Rating Description 4 stars correct match as context is right (i.e., molecule is known/expected to be in the sample) 3 stars compound class match \u2013 at least part of the structure makes sense to match 2 stars cannot tell \u2013 might be correct from the spectrum match and context but there is not enough information to tell 1 star incorrect: molecule does not make sense in this context Users will be able to both add their own rating, add a comment for their given rating, as well as view the average rating of the identification. Continuous ID Subscription Email This example continuous identification email informs subscribers that the dataset of interest has more IDs in the most recent round of continuous identifications. It will first list the title of the dataset, then the changes in identification counts, and finally direct links to explore the data. Users can go directly to the search results and view the new, different, and deleted identifications as well as go straight to the dataset page itself.","title":"Continuous Identification"},{"location":"continuousid/#continuous-identification","text":"GNPS' continuous identification aims to bring datasets to life.

Using Cytoscape, we can start visualizing the entire molecular network at once. Cytoscape is an open source software platform for visualization and annotation of networks. Cytoscape is available for download from here . The instructions below assume that you have installed Cytoscape 3.6.X. Cytoscape 3.6 Analysis (Quick) To quickly get started with your molecular network in Cytoscape, we have an easy export module from GNPS that previews the molecular network and provides a pre-formatted Cytoscape file. This feature is very much experimental, but from the status page, click the \"Direct Cytoscape Preview/Download\" This will bring you to a new interface where you will see a preview and a download link. Cytoscape 3.6 Analysis (Recommended) Downloading Cytoscape Import Files The first step is to download the correct input to import into Cytoscape. From the results page of molecular networking, you will need to download the graphML file for Cytoscape. Unzip the content of the zip file. The content will look like this: Importing Network into Cytoscape Now open Cytoscape 3.6.1. From the Toolbar go to File / Import / Network / File (or cmd + L) and then select the .graphml file in the root of the unzipped job folder. The network has been opened and will look like this. Creating a Cytoscape Style In Cytoscape 3.6.1, create a new Cytoscape style. As shown below, click on \"Create New Style\" and provide a name. Node Styling Node Label to Spectrum Property Within the Node menu, you will be able to apply a label to each of your nodes, you may select the Attribute from the drop down menu to use as a label and then select Passthrough Mapping as the Mapping Type. Typically Parent mass or Precursor mass is selected for node labels of networks generated using GNPS. Visualizing Group Abundances as Pie Charts If you organized your data into cohorts of samples, we can visualize the relative abundance (as measured by spectral counts which is psuedo-quantitative) with pie charts across these groups. Visualizing Structures The Cytoscape plugin ChemViz2 can visualize the chemical structure of GNPS spectral library annotation in the nodes. The ChemViz2 plugin can be be installed in the toolbar Apps /Apps manager / and type \"ChemViz2\" to find and install it. To visualize chemical structures, select the nodes of interest and do right-click, Apps / Cheminformatics tools / Paint structure on selected nodes. Also check out their website . Edge Styling Edge Thickness based on Spectral Similarity To aid in the visualization of individual node relatedness within a cluster, the cosine score is used. This value will determine the thickness of the edge between related nodes. The thicker the edge, the higher the cosine score and therefore the more related the two individual nodes are to each other. Again working within the Style Tab, select the Edge menu. From the Width drop down menu, select Cosine for the Column and Continuous Mapping for the Mapping Type. Double click on the Continuous Mapping area of the menu to adjust the thickness of the edge. Click OK to apply the setting changes. Below is a zoomed in portion of a network demonstrating the use of Cosine score for edge width determination.

A: Data you upload to analyze at GNPS will remain private unless you explicitly make it public. The two ways to make your data public are to create MassIVE datasets that make entire datasets public or add individual annotated MS/MS spectra to GNPS spectral libraries. Q: Will MassIVE datasets that I create be public by default? A: No, when creating a MassIVE dataset, it is not public by default. On the input form page, you are able to set a password to access the MassIVE dataset. There is a Make Public link to make your dataset open to the public and documentation can be found here here. Such a feature is very useful because users can create a MassIVE dataset prior to publication submission that is private and password protected. The MassIVE dataset link can be provided to reviewers along with the password so to provide better transparency and increase probability of manuscript acceptance. Data Organization Q: How does the MassIVE data differ from the GNPS spectral libraries? A: MassIVE datasets consist of raw data. GNPS spectral libraries consist of spectra that have been individually assigned an identification. Q: Can I create my own private spectral libraries? A: Yes, but it is not recommended. Please contact administrators for further details. Spectral Libraries Q: How do I get access to the public spectral libraries? A: On the select input files popup, click on the shared files tab, and enter speclibs as an import share. Analyzing Data Q: Can I select more than one file at a time for each group in molecular networking? A: Yes. Within each group you can select multiple files, even folders of spectra.

The main documentation for Feature-Based Molecular Networking can be accessed here: The documentation for Feature-Based Molecular Networking and Cytoscape is provided below. Feature-Based Molecular Networking in Cytoscape Cytoscape is an open source software platform used to visualize, analyze and annotate molecular networks from GNPS.

Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks. Genome Res, 13 (11), 2498-2504. doi:10.1101/gr.1239303 Downloading Cytoscape Files from GNPS The first step is to download the input file (.graphML file format) for import into Cytoscape. From the job status page in the Feature-Based Molecular Networking workflow, click on Download Cytoscape Data . Save and unzip the downloaded file. Unzip the file and the resulting folder will look like this: Importing Files from GNPS to Cytoscape To import the network file into Cytoscape: * in Cytoscape click on Import Network from File System and then choose the .graphml file. * Alternatively, you can drag and drop the .graphml file into Cytoscape. The imported network will be displayed in the main window. In the Control Panel (left panel), in the Network tab, rename the network with right-click and select Rename Network . Rotation of the Network To rotate the entire molecular network choose the tab Layout and click on Node Layout tool . In the opened window, unclick the box Selected Only to rotate the entire network and move the blue bar to 90. You can also select specific subnetworks and rotate them by clicking the box Selected only . Table Panel Visualization Data For advance network visualisation and data analysis, you may click on Table Panel and select node or edge column information (network metadata) to be displayed. For example, in the Node Table , you can select the \" Compound_name\" (name of the spectral library match), the \" parent mass\" (precursor ion mass), the \" RTconsensus\" (retention time for the node), \" MZErrorPPM\" (ppm error with the spectral library match) and any attributes of interest in your in Node Table (node metadata). Create a New Style A style can be created by clicking on Create New Style and a style name can be specified (e.g. \"High vs Low Plant Consumer\"). The created style can be exported by going in the main menu to File Export Styles to File , or a previous style can be imported by clicking on Import Style From File in the File section. Edit the Style Node Styling Label In the Control Panel (left panel), go to the Style tab. Within the Node sub-tab, the properties of the node style can be modified. For example, you can choose the precursor mass as node label for the molecular networks [you need to select Passthrough Mapping as the Mapping Type ]. Go to Properties to display more style properties. Size In Style panel, at Size option, select \" SumPeakIntensity\" (sum of ion intensities across samples, derived from the LC-MS peak area) or the \" number of spectra \" (occurence of the ion across samples, e.g count of 1 if not zero) as Column and Continuous Mapping as Mapping Type . The opened window allows to modify the node size in function of the node metadata column chosen. Begin by setting the value for minimum and maximum node size value with the button Set Min and Max , in order to achieve a satisfying network representation. Although it is not recommended, it is possible to use a non-linear continuous mapping. Pie charts If you used a metadata table, the node table will contain group columns for each group specified in the metadata table. The group columns starts with \"_GNPSGROUP__\" and will consist of the mean (default and recommended) or summed intensity of the ion across the group's samples based on the MS1 feature table (LC-MS peak area). This group columns can be used to visualize groups as pie charts in the network. To start visualizing pie charts on node for the groups, click on the left box ( Def column) for the Image/Chart1 node property. Choose the Charts tab and select the Pie Chart Icon . Now, in the Data sub-tab, select the group columns you are interested in visualizing in the Select Columns box (e.g. \" GNPSGROUP: Less_than 5\" (low plant consumers) and \" GNPSGROUP:More_than_30\" (high plant consumers)). Click on Options (below Data ) to choose colors for the Groups (groups are numerized based on their position in the Selected Columns box). Click Apply when you are done with your selection. Edge Styling Width To aid in the visualization of individual node relatedness within a cluster, the cosine score is displayed as an edge. The cosine scores define similarity between two MS/MS spectra. Scores ranging from 0 (totally dissimilar) to 1 (identical). The edge thickness can be used to visualize the cosine score value between related nodes. For this we will use the cosine score based continuous mapping for the edge thickness. Go to the Style tab, and the Edge sub-tab. From the Width property drop down menu, select \" cosine_score\" for the Column and Continuous Mapping for the Mapping Type . Double click on the Continuous Mapping area of the menu to adjust the thickness of the edge. Click OK to apply the setting changes. Optimise the minimum and maximum value for the continuous mapping. Mining information in the network The Toolbar function The Cytoscape's toolbar can be used to search nodes or edge metadata (e.g., \" shared name \"). Note that this feature is very slow, especially with large network. The list of nodes in the Note Table will be updated. You can select nodes of interest, perform right-click for Select nodes and then click on the + magnifier in the main menu to perform a zoom on the selected node. The Select function The Select function can be used to create a selection of nodes and/or edges based on their metadata and/or network topology. Go to the Control Panel and click on Select tab. Then, click on the \" + \" button and choose between column, degree, or topology filter(s) to add different filter properties. The \" x \" button deletes the corresponding property. For each filter property, various options are provided depending on the column type (numeric column: is , is not , between ; for string column: contains and does not contain . Here, we create annotation filter who selects nodes with a spectral library match with 10 ppm maximum error between precursor ions (\" MZErrorPPM \" from 0 to 10). By default, the filter should be automatically applied to the network, otherwise click on Apply . Below Filter tab, the number of nodes meeting the filter property variables (here 160 nodes) will be selected. These nodes are automatically selected and highlighted in yellow in the network. Filters are very powerful network analysis tools that can be modified, saved and exported. To rename, remove, create a new filter, or other options, click on the right button beside the Filter list menu. The list of available Filters will appear in the top part of the panel. For more details and options, follow this link . Bypass mode for style property A bypass could be applied on selected nodes and/or edged by going into the Style panel, and clicking on the Byp. _column for the property you want to change such as _Border paint and Border Width . For modifying or removing the bypass property, select the nodes concerned, click right and choose Remove Bypass or set Bypass option. Drawing structure in nodes The chemical structures can be visualized in the node using chemViz2 bioinformatics plugin for Cytoscape ( http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/cytoscape/chemViz/ ). First the chemViz2 plugin has to be installed. To do that, in the main menu, go to Apps tab then open App Manager . In the Install Apps click on chemViz2 and install it by clicking on the Install button. For more information about chemViz2, refer to the information available in the following chemViz2 website link . Once installed, chemViz2 can be used to display chemical structures on nodes. First, you will have to verify that the chemViz2 is properly parameterized. Select Apps in the main menu, go to Cheminformatics Tools and click on Setting . In Attribute Settings , choose for the SMILES Attribute the node.Smiles value and/or for InCHI Attribute the node.INCHI value. Apply it by clicking on the OK button. Finally, to draw structures in nodes, return to Apps and Cheminformatics Tools to go to Paint Structures and select on all nodes or on selected nodes . Visualize the results. If needed, create a dedicated style to facilitate structure visualization.","title":"Cytoscape Documentation"},{"location":"featurebasedmolecularnetworking-cytoscape/#introduction-to-fbmn","text":"The Feature-Based Molecular Networking (FBMN) is a computational method that bridges popular mass spectrometry data processing tools for LC-MS/MS and molecular networking analysis on GNPS .

Mass Spectrometry Data Processing with MS-DIAL In MS-DIAL, a sequence of steps is performed to process the mass spectrometry data. Here we will present key steps required to process LC-MS/MS data acquired in non-targeted mode (data dependent acquisition). For conveniency we are also providing a batch file (XML format) that can be imported directly in MS-DIAL. IMPORTANT: MS-DIAL parameters will vary depending on the mass spectrometer, the acquisition parameters, and the sample studied. The following documentation serves a basic guideline for using MS-DIAL with the Feature-Based Molecular Networking workflow. Please consult these resources for more details on MS-DIAL processing: The official MS-DIAL tutorial The video tutorial about MS-DIAL processing for Feature Based Molecular Networking . Convert your LC-MS/MS Data to Open Format MS-DIAL accepts different input formats. Note that we recommand to first convert your files to mzML format before doing MS-DIAL processing. See the documentation here . Processing Steps Below is a walk through of all the steps 1. Make a New Project Go to Menu: File / New Project Select proper parameters (ionization type / method type / data type / ion mode / target omics) for your dataset. Click \u201cnext\u201d button. 2. Import Files Click \u201cbrowse\u201d and open the dropdown menu for file types, and select \u201cmzML file(*.mzml)\u201d. The other available options are .abf or .cdf files. [Note] Data files should be placed at the same folder with the project file. Select files and click the \u201copen\u201d button. You will see the list of selected files. Click the \u201cnext\u201d button. 3. Set Parameters - Data Collection Set the MS1/MS2 tolerance and data collection parameters. If you are dealing with a large dataset, you can reduce the running time by setting multithreading option in the \u201cadvanced\u201d menu. 4. Set Parameters - Peak Detection Set the MS1 peak detection parameters. You should set a appropriate peak height threshold. As a rule of thumb, the value should at least correspond to the minimum value set for the triggering of the MS2 scan event. If you want to remove some specific ions (e.g. known contaminants), you can make an exclusion list here. 5. Set Parameters - MS2Deconvolution You should set a appropriate MS/MS abundance cutoff. Make sure to set an intensity threshold representative of noise level in the MS2 spectrum. This is typically lower than for MS1. If you have any doubt, set it to 0. 6. Set Parameters - Alignment Set appropriate Retention time / MS1 tolerance for alignment. If you have any QC sample data, it will be a nice candidate to be the reference file. Click the \u201cfinish\u201d button, then MS-DIAL will perform all the feature finding process. Export or/and submit the files needed for Feature-Based Molecular Networking on GNPS: a feature table with ion intensities (.CSV file format) a list of the MS/MS spectra (.MGF file format) (the most intense MS/MS per feature is selected). Menu: Export / Alignment result Select the \u201cGNPS export\u201d option, and make the spectra type to \u201ccentroid\u201d. Set the directory and file name, then click \u201cexport\u201d. As a result, you will acquire a .mgf file and a feature abundance table. [Note] GNPS export module of MS-DIAL will create a feature table based on MS1 peak height.

The values have to be defined according to your experimental setup (expected chromatographic peak width and the MS mass accuracy). Example for a UHPLC colum (1.7 \u00b5m C18, 50 \u00d7 2.1 mm, flow rate of 0.5 mL/min): maXis-QTOF: 12 min gradient, 0.02 Da and 0.15 min Q-Exactive: 5 min gradient, 0.01 Da and 0.1 min 5. Group isotopes and co-eluting ions Use the \"Isotopic peaks grouper module\" [recommended] or other alternative (such as the CAMERA module). Go to Menu: Peak list methods / Isotopes / Isotopic peaks grouper. IMPORTANT: This depends on your expected peak shapes, duty cycle time and the MS mass accuracy. (Example: MAXIS-QTOF, 10 min grdainet, 0.1 min, 0.02 m/z; Q-Eaxtive, 5 min gradient, 0.05 min, 0.01 m/z) 6. Order the peaklists Go to Menu: Peak list methods / Order peak lists. IMPORTANT: This is to ensure reproducibility of results. Indeed, the aligned peaklist will change slighlty if that step is not performed. 7. Align Features In this step, the peak lists from each samples will be aligned in one aligned peak list. Go to Menu: Peak list methods / Alignment / Join aligner 8. Detect Missing Peaks / Gap Filling (Optional) Gap filling enables to retrieve the intensity of a peak in all the samples, even if it was not detected in a previous processing step. Go to Menu: Peak list methods / Gap filling / Peak finder (multi-threaded). IMPORTANT: This step is optional. Use the multi-threaded peak finder for fast processing. 9. Filter the Peaklist to MS/MS Peaks (Optional) Depending on the number of features in the aligned peaklist, it is possible to filter the peaklist to keep only features with minimum number of occurences (\"Minimum peaks in a row\") or a mininum number of isotopic peaks for the feature (\"Minimum peaks in an isotope pattern\"), or to \"Keep only peaks with MS2 scan (GNPS)\". Go to Menu: Peak list methods / Filtering / Peak list row filter / Select the filters IMPORTANT: if you use a filter, we recommend using the filter \"Reset the peak number ID\" NOTE that this step was mandatory in the previous version of FBMN with MZmine2, now it is now optional. 10. Export the Feature Table and MGF file Export or/and submit the files needed for Feature-Based Molecular Networking on GNPS: a feature table with ion intensities (.CSV file format) a list of the MS/MS spectra (.MGF file format) (the most intense MS/MS per feature is selected). Select the last \"filtered aligned peaklist\" and Go to Menu: \"Peak list methods\" / \"Export\" / \"Export for/Submit to GNPS\" See an example of files outputted by the export module using the workflow: here . The files can be uploaded to the GNPS web-platform and Feature-Based Molecular Networking job can be directly launched IMPORTANT: While the possibility to submit the files directly to GNPS and launch a FBMN job on the fly is really convenient for quick data analysis, the job and files will not be saved to your personal account on GNPS, and you are limited to basic presets of parameters. For that reason, we recommend to upload your files with the FTP uploader [(see documentation)] (https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/fileupload/) and prepare your job directly on GNPS (you must be logged in first). In the \"Export for/Submit to GNPS\" module, select the option: \"Submit to GNPS\" [Optional] Metadata file: specify the path to the metadata table in GNPS format. [See documentation here] (networking/#metadata) Select the parameters presets for the GNPS job. Email: specify the email to forward the job link Annotation edges (Experimental): that option can be ignored. Open website: if ticked, will open the job webpage. ADDITIONAL NOTES: The feature table must contain at least the row ID, the row m/z, and row retention time, along with the sample columns. It is currently mandatory for the sample name headers string to have the following format: \"filename Peak area\". Depending on Note that depending on the steps used in MZmine the sample name header can be \"filename baseline-corrected Peak area\", but this has to changed back to \"filename Peak area\". Feature Based Molecular Networking in GNPS The workflow for Feature Based Molecular Networking in GNPS is different from the classic molecular networking workflow. Access the FBMN workflow here (You need to be logged in first !) More information on the Feature Based Molecular Networking workflow on GNPS can be obtained on that documentation page Basically, you will need to upload the files ouputted by the MZmine2 processing (test files are accessible here ): Feature Table from above MGF for MS/MS from above Metadata table - described here There are several additional normalization options specifically for feature detection. We can normalize the features per LC/MS run and aggregate by groups with either a sum or average (recommended).

Mass spectrometry data Feature Detection with MZmine2 [RECOMMENDED] Currently, we are recommending using the MZmine2 workflow, as it has been thoroughly tested. See the documentation here and the following video tutorial: The Feature Based Molecular Networking Workflow in GNPS There is a dedicated Feature-Based Molecular Networking workflow on GNPS that can be accessed here (you need to be logged in GNPS first). You will need three items (test files are accessible here ): The Feature Table with the intensity of ion features (Peak Area Quantification Table). The MGF file with the list of MS/MS spectra for the ion features (MS2 MGF File). [Optional] the Metadata table - described here Overview of the Feature Based Molecular Networking Workflow Select the software used for the LC-MS/MS data processing Set the parameters as needed Basic Options Parameter Description Default Precursor Ion Mass Tolerance (PIMT) Parameter used for spectral library search. Specify the precursor ions mass tolerance, in Daltons. Note that the value of this parameters should be consistent with the capabilities of the mass spectrometer and the specific instrument method used to generated the MS/MS data. Recommended Values value is \u00b1 0.02 Da for high-resolution instruments such q-TOF, or 0.01 for Q-Exactive, and \u00b1 2.0 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ). 2.0 Fragment Ion Mass Tolerance (FIMT) Parameters used spectra pair-wise comparison in MS/MS molecular networking. This value specifies how much fragment ions can be shifted from their potential counter-parts found in the other MS/MS spectra Recommended Values value is \u00b1 0.02 or 0.01 Da for high-resolution instruments (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap) and \u00b1 0.5 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ). 0.5 Advanced Network Options Parameter Description Default Notes Min Pairs Cos Minimum cosine score that must occur between a pair of consensus MS/MS spectra in order for an edge to be formed in the molecular network 0.7 Lower value will increase the size of the clusters by inducing the clustering of less related MS/MS spectra, higher value will limit do the opposite. Minimum Matched Fragment Ion (Min Matched Peaks) Parameters used for molecular networking. Is the minimum number of common fragment ions that are shared by two separate consensus MS/MS spectra in order to be connected by an edge in the molecular network 6 A low value will permit linkages between spectra of molecules with few similar fragment ions, but it will result in many more less-related spectra being connected to the network. An higher value will do the opposite. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be adjusted depending on the experimental conditions for mass spectra acquisition (such as mode of ionisation, fragmentation conditions, and the mobile phase, ...), and the collision-induced fragmentation behavior of the molecules of interest within the samples. High molecular weight (MW) compounds, and compounds with more hetero-atoms will generally tend to produce more fragment ions. However, this rule cannot be systematized. For example, some lipids with high MW generate only few fragment ions. Maximum shift between precursors The maximum structure modification mass between two spectra to be considered direct neighbors in a molecular network 500 The maximum mass difference between two connected nodes in a molecular network. Network TopK Maximum number of neighbor nodes for one single node 10 The edge between two nodes are kept only if both nodes are within each other's \u2018TopK\u2019 most similar nodes. For example, if this value is set at 20, then a single node may be connected to up to 20 other nodes. Keeping this value low makes very large networks (many nodes) much easier to visualize. Maximum Connected Component Size Maximum size of nodes allowed in a single connected network 100 Maximum size of nodes allowed in a single connected network. Nodes within a single connected molecular network will be separated by increasing cosine threshold for that specific connected molecular network. Default value is 100. Use 0 to allow an unlimited number of nodes in a single network. Note that with large datasets, or when a great number of related molecules are in the dataset, this value should be higher (or turn to 0) to retain as much information as possible. Downstream, these larger networks can be visualized using Cytoscape layout algorithms that can increase the intra-network clustering, allowing to visualize spectral groups in the network despite the number of nodes in the network. Advanced Library Search Options Parameter Description Default Library Search Min Matched Peaks Minimum number of common fragment ions that MS/MS spectra should contain in order to be considered for spectral library annotation. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be tuned depending of the molecule of interest, and the experimental conditions (such as the ionisation mode, and the fragmentation conditions, ...). For example, collision-induced fragmentation of some lipids produce only few fragment ions. A lower value will allow clustering of MS/MS spectra containing less fragment ions, however it will also induce clustering of MS/MS spectra from different molecular-type to be connected in one network. An higher value will do the opposite 6 Score Threshold Minimum cosine score that MS/MS spectra should get in spectral matching with MS/MS spectral libraries in order to be considered an annotation. 0.7 Search Analogs Will for library match in analog mode (precursor ion mass shifted up the mass difference specified, such as 100 Da) to library spectra Don't Search Maximum Analog Search Mass Difference Maximum precursor ion mass shift between library and putative analog found 100 (Da) Top results to report per query Number of matches to report for each feature 1 Advanced Filtering Options Parameter Description Default Minimum Peak Intensity All fragment ions in the MS/MS spectrum below this raw intensity will be deleted. By default, no filter. 0 Filter Precursor Window All peaks in a +/- 17 Da around precursor ion mass are deleted. By default, yes filter. This removes the residual precursor ion, which is frequently observed in MS/MS spectra acquired on qTOFs. Filter Filter library Apply peak filters to library Filter Filter peaks in 50Da Window Filter out peaks that are not top 6 most intense peaks in a +/- 50Da window Filter Advanced quantification options There are additional normalization options specifically for the FBMN workflow: Parameter Description Default Normalization Per File Total Ion Current (TIC) normalization can be applied to the ion intensities (LC-MS1 peak area) per sample (NOT RECOMMENDED AS DEFAULT) No Norm Aggregation Method for Peak Abundances Per Group The ion feature intensity (LC-MS1 peak area) can be aggregated by GROUPS from the metadatable with either a Sum or Average (RECOMMENDED, because more robust to the number of samples per GROUPS).

Recommended Analysis Tools Molecular Networking Molecular networks are visual displays of the chemical space present in tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments. This approach groups sets of spectra from related molecules (known as molecular families) even when the spectra themselves are not identified (do not match to any known compounds). Molecular networks in GNPS represents each spectrum as a node, and spectrum-to-spectrum alignments as edges (similar fragmentation implying similar structure) between nodes. Nodes can be supplemented with metadata, including library matches matches or information that is provided by the user, e.g. abundance, origin of product, hydrophobicity, etc. These metadata attributes can be reflected in a node\u2019s size or color. Spectral Library Search MS/MS data is searched against reference GNPS spectral libraries in a high throughput manner, scaling up to hundreds of files at a time. The spectral library search can be configured to either match exactly to known molecules or utilize variable dereplication to identify putative analogs of known compounds. MASST Query a single MS/MS spectrum across all public GNPS datasets. The mass spectrometry equivalent of NCBI BLAST helps to put the query spectrum in context of where else it occurs as well as search a single MS/MS spectrum against all public spectral libraries. Advanced Analysis Tools Dereplicator The Insilico Peptidic Natural Products Dereplicator is a bioinformatic tool that allows the annotation of known peptidic natural products in MS/MS data using in silico fragmentation tree. Network Annotation Propogation Network Annotation Propagation (NAP) uses spectral networks to propagate information from spectral library matching, in order to improve in silico fragmentation candidate structure ranking.

Below are additional guidelines that describe the kinds of data that GNPS's analysis tools and shared knowledgebase handle. Ionization Type GNPS supports data from soft ionization sources, e.g. electro spray ionization (ESI), Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI), Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). Fragmentation GNPS only accepts data dependent acquisition data (DDA), i.e. molecules were fragmented with collision induced dissociation (CID), Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD), or Electron-transfer dissociation (ETD). This produces tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) that can be identified via spectral library search and organized into families of molecules with molecular networking. Data Sizes GNPS was designed to process MS/MS datasets of entire LC/MS runs. Many of the analysis tools were meant for datasets with at least hundreds of MS/MS spectra. While it is feasible to analyze a small amount of MS/MS spectra, certain capabilities (e.g. Molecular Networking) will not be effective at such small scales. For extremely small datasets (e.g. single MS/MS spectra), we recommend utilizing our MASST search tool and not molecular networking. For datasets that at least include an entire LC/MS run of MS/MS spectra, all workflows will accept. For molecular networking, please refer to the parameters and presets .

Mass2Motifs are fragmentation patterns of often co-occurring mass fragment peaks and/or neutral losses that often represent molecular substructures. Check out the MS2LDA website here where you can find more information, browse through data sets, and sign up for an account to run the Mass2Motif discovery on your own data. At GNPS, we are working with the MS2LDA team to integrate both workflows which allows users to map Mass2Motif occurrences in their Molecular Families. It is now also possible to run MS2LDA analyses through the GNPS interface here which will lead to the below displayed job entry page. In this section, it is explained what input files are needed, how the parameters can be chosen, and what kind of output you get. Finally, it is explained how the obtained MS2LDA model can be further explored on the MS2LDA website by uploading the generated dict file. Collecting the right input files After providing the GNPS analysis with a title, the right input files are needed to start an MS2LDA analysis: Required: Spectral data (MGF file) which can be downloaded from a processed Molecular Networking job Required: Edges file including selfloops which can be downloaded from a processed Molecular Networking job (i.e., typically found in the networkedges_selfloop folder within the downloaded GNPS job folder) Optional: MS1 peak abundance information (CSV file generated by MzMine) - choose \"MzMine2 (Feature based Molecular Networking)\" workflow if this file is provided. This will allow you to perform MS1 differential analysis within the MS2LDA web app to find discriminate Mass2Motifs between groups. After selecting the input files, the right MGF Source needs to be selected: \"MSCluster\" for a classical Molecular Networking derived clustered MGF file, and \"MzMine2\" for a Feature based Molecular Networking derived MGF file. Quick start from processed Molecular Network To facilitate MS2LDA analysis of processed Molecular Networking jobs, in the newest (V2) version under \"Advanced Views - Experimental Views\" there is a button Analyze with MS2LDA that will bring you directly to the MS2LDA analysis page prefilling the relevant input files (spectral MGF file and edge pair file including selfloops). See also the animated GIF below. Please note that you can adapt the title and you must check the relevant MS2LDA parameter settings for your data set. Setting the MS2LDA parameters There are three sections of parameters to fill out of which the first is the most important. Default values are provided for all settings, but each of them is dependent on the input data. We provide some guidelines here to ease your choice. LDA parameters The \"Advanced MS2LDA parameters\" displays four parameter values to set. The first is the bin width used to bin the MS2 fragments and losses. Defaults for Q-Exactive (0.005 Da) and ToF (0.01 Da) Data are provided. For instruments like Ion Traps a larger bin width of 0.1 Da is recommended. The appropriate bin width to choose is dependent on the expected mass variation of mass fragments across mass spectra in your data. The number of LDA iterations is set to 1000 by default which should work in most cases. The Minimum MS2 Intensity is meant to filter out the basic noise from the MS/MS spectra. It is recommended to open the inputted MGF file and check the noise levels. Typically they range from 25-200 (ToF Data) to 5000 (Q-Exactive Data). Inclusion of noise will unnecessarily lengten the analysis time and create non-informative Mass2Motifs. The LDA Free Motifs correspond to the number of \"free Mass2Motifs\" that are added on top of the prefixed annotated Mass2Motifs from MotifDB. This number depends on your data: if you input a larger number of fragmented molecules (i.e., 4,000) that includes lots of novel chemistry not present in MotifDB it is best to put the LDA Free Motifs on 300 - 500. If the data set is relatively small with a considerable amount of known chemistry, you best put this number to 50 - 150. Selecting MotifDB motif sets By default all Motif Sets will be imported from MotifDB . However, it is wise to exclude annotated motif sets of sources that are very distant from the source of your input data. Note that the GNPS and MassBank are annotated Mass2Motifs discovered in reference molecules. Output Networking file thresholds After running MS2LDA, output files are created that include a new networking (edge) file that can be used to create an enriched Molecular Network including Mass2Motif distributions through the Molecular Families. To do so, cut-off values (thresholds) are needed for LDA scores to consider a Mass2Motif to be linked to a molecule or not and how many you want to show in the network. Default values are provided that were found to work well so far. In this publication the two scores are explained: probability and overlap score. Note that you will have to provide your email address in the appropriate field in order to be notified upon completion of your GNPS-MS2LDA job. MS2LDA output files Upon succesful completion, you will be able to see the output job page as displayed below: There are different views and files for download available: View Motif Labels for Spectra This view displays all the fragmented molecules (scans) and each of the motifs linked to them [above the set thresholds as specified in the Output Networking file thresholds]. It can be downloaded as a tab separated file. Individual Motif Details This view displays all molecule-motif links [some molecules have more than one motif linked and will appear multiple times in this table] and also shows the annotation if available from MotifDB. It can be downloaded as a tab separated file. View Pairs with Motif Edges This view is the new edge file enriched with Motif interactions: note that in the \"Interact\" column apart from cosine now different Mass2Motifs are listed [above the set thresholds as specified in the Output Networking file thresholds]. It can be downloaded as a tab separated file - this can be used to create a new enriched Molecular Network in CytoScape. View Motif PDF This displays a PDF report of all the Mass2Motifs. Each Mass2Motif spans two pages with the first page a graphical overview of the relevant mass fragments (red, on top, pointing up) and neutral losses (green, bottom, pointing down) with the y-axis being the intensity which equals the features' probability to be found in the Mass2Motif, and the x-axis being the m/z (rounded up to nominal values in the labels) in Daltons. The second page displays the top mass fragments and neutral losses with their probabilities. Download Motif PDF This downloads the PDF report as explained in \"View Motif PDF\". Download Pairs This downloads the new edge file as explained in \"View Pairs with Motif Edges\". Download MS2LDA Dict This downloads the MS2LDA Dict file that houses all the relevant information on the MS2LDA experiment. Analysing the MS2LDA results within GNPS The different available views enable a quick overview of the MS2LDA experiment. Especially when annotated Mass2Motifs are found, this could help in further downstream analysis. However, when no annotation is provided, the Mass2Motif is one of the \"free Motifs\" that was discovered by LDA. With the MS2LDA Dict file through the MS2LDA web app there are ways to analyse these Mass2Motifs further and also annotate them. In general, when analysing annotating or novel Mass2Motifs, it is important to keep this in mind! Taking the GNPS results into the MS2LDA web app After downloading the MS2LSA Dict file from the finished MS2LDA experiment, this can be uploaded into the MS2LDA web app . There is a User Guide available that covers the main functionalities of the MS2LDA web app. If it is your first time at the MS2LDA web app, make sure you get a login account before continuing. Once logged in, go to the experiments section: By default, you arrive on the Create tab which lets you create an MS2LDA experiment from mass spectrometry data. Click on the Upload tab, to continue: Now, you will have to provide a unique name for the MS2LDA experiment and you can also provide relevant details. Most importantly, you will need to select the location of the downloaded MS2LDA Dict file under \"LDA output file\". Also, you will need to select the bin width as used in the GNPS-MS2LDA workflow (\"Bin Width\") from the available options. After you are ready, you can click \"Upload Your Experiment\" and the upload will start. Annotating new motifs Once the MS2LDA dict file finished uploading, you can browse the MS2LDA experiment in the web app like a regular MS2LDa experiment. If you click on the experiment name, multiple tabs will appear: Here, you can click on the Summary Page tab which leads you to the summary of the experiment that includes all relevant Tables. For example, the Motif Table can be browsed, sorted, searched, and downloaded as CSV: When clicking on the relevant \"free Motif\" name a Motif Page will appear where the relevant mass fragment and neutral losses are listed including their scores and a frequency plot. Also, all the spectra the Mass2Motif appears in can be browsed to analyse the nature of the fragmentation pattern. Importantly, if you can annote the motif with any structural information, this can be provided on top of the page with the Annotation field for the full annotation and the Short Annotation field for a label to display in graphics - make sure to save the Motif Page afterwards! After reloading the Summary Page or the Show Mass2Motif tabs, the annotation(s) will be displayed and are searchable. Finally, on top of the summary page there is a toggle where you can make the entire MS2LDA experiment public. See for example the public MassBank Experiment . MS1 Differential Analyses within the MS2LDA web app If the Feature based Molecular Networking workflow was used, the MS1 peak information is available in the MS2LDA Dict file. This can be used to create MS1 analysis to find Mass2Motif that are discriminative between two sample groups. More information can be found in this publication and the MS2LDA web app User Guide explains how to set up such an analysis within your experiment. Uploading annotated motif sets into MotifDB This is a future feature that will become available in the course of this year. It will allow you to make your new annotations searchable and usable by the community. Future Directions At GNPS, we are working with the MS2LDA team to promote publication of curated sets of Mass2Motifs into MotifDB that can help to annotate your MS/MS spectra.

The first is the bin width used to bin the MS2 fragments and losses. Defaults for Q-Exactive (0.005 Da) and ToF (0.01 Da) Data are provided. For instruments like Ion Traps a larger bin width of 0.1 Da is recommended. The appropriate bin width to choose is dependent on the expected mass variation of mass fragments across mass spectra in your data. The number of LDA iterations is set to 1000 by default which should work in most cases. The Minimum MS2 Intensity is meant to filter out the basic noise from the MS/MS spectra. It is recommended to open the inputted MGF file and check the noise levels. Typically they range from 25-200 (ToF Data) to 5000 (Q-Exactive Data). Inclusion of noise will unnecessarily lengten the analysis time and create non-informative Mass2Motifs. The LDA Free Motifs correspond to the number of \"free Mass2Motifs\" that are added on top of the prefixed annotated Mass2Motifs from MotifDB. This number depends on your data: if you input a larger number of fragmented molecules (i.e., 4,000) that includes lots of novel chemistry not present in MotifDB it is best to put the LDA Free Motifs on 300 - 500. If the data set is relatively small with a considerable amount of known chemistry, you best put this number to 50 - 150.","title":"LDA parameters"},{"location":"ms2lda/#selecting-motifdb-motif-sets","text":"By default all Motif Sets will be imported from MotifDB .

NAP allows the combination of different databases, either through multiple database identifiers, or by the combination of identifiers and text file.

Running NAP NAP Workflow Selection From the main GNPS page , you can access NAP clicking the banner and then selecting NAP in the corresponding description. You can also directly open clicking \"here\" . This will take you to the workflow input to start NAP. The image below shows an example of the most important parameters The first parameter is the GNPS network task id, this id can be found in the results email sent by GNPS or in the url, as shown in the image below, the task id is '3b215c4b25594b9c85d92de547815c0a' and the molecular family (connected component) containing the 'cluster index' 56 can be inspected in the molecular network . A detailed description of the parameters is provided below . Parameter Walkthrough Parameter Description Default GNPS job ID GNPS molecular networking task id. Number of a cluster index Any cluster index of a connected component of interest in a Molecular Network. The propagation is limited by the connected component. Cosine value to subselect inside a cluster Used to disconnect nodes in very dense molecular networks and decrease the number of nodes to be analyzed. 0.5 N first candidates for consensus score Number of candidate structures of the neighbor nodes used for Consensus re-ranking. 10 Use fusion result for consensus Whether to use the result from Fusion re-ranking to perform Consensus re-ranking. 1 Accuracy for exact mass candidate search (ppm) Accuracy used for structure database search.

Maximum number of candidate structures in the graph: Number od candidate structures to be exported in the Cytoscape graph. 10 Workflow type Standard or MZmine . Online Exploration of NAP results After completing a NAP workflow, the results can be browsed in the web interface. The web interface provides a quick and easy way to perform initial analysis of your data, particularly if you are interested in a specific structure or class of structures and want to inspect in the results. To have access to the web interface click on the 'EXPERIMENTAL - NAPviewer' at the results page: The result summaries can be divided in four sections. 1. Structure view NAP attempts to re-rank the candidate structures provided by MetFrag using the information provided by the molecular network. This first view shows the S tructures ranked by MetFrag and the ones re-ranked by NAP to allow the user to quickly inspect if the propagation improved the ranking: 2. Graph view As the re-ranking is performing obtaining information from neighbor nodes, the G raph view displays the direct neighbor's first candidate structures of a given re-ranked node to allow the user to inspect if the re-ranking is consistent in the network: The node border colors indicate the source of structure: green - reference spectral library structure; magenta MetFrag's first candidate; blue Fusion's first candidate and red Consensus' first candidate. 3. Fragment view Some important aspects of structural prediction are: how many fragments were predicted, which fragments and which substructures were assigned to the predictions. The F ragment view displays the direct fragments predicted for each structure in the candidate list of a given fragmentation spectrum (represented by a node in the network): By hovering the mouse over the candidate fragment it is possible to see the substructure predicted for the fragment. 4. Full candidate list view As structural prediction is very challenging. The correct candidate may not be the first in the list, therefore it is important to be able to browse the candidate list. The Link containing the full list of candidate structures found in NAP search is provided. The first column of the candidate's table contains a link out for the respective database where the structure was originated. The table also contains the ranking for MetFrag, Fusion and Consensus, the link for number of fragments predicted for each candidate structure, a link to fragment plot representation and a column with color coded structural similarity grouping that can be easily associated with candidate's ClassyFire class, when available: NAP Visualization in Cytoscape In a similar way as Molecular Networking uses Cytoscape to visualize the whole network, we can visualize structure prediction of entire connected component or networks using the output from NAP. Cytoscape (we have used version = 3.4) is available for download from here . Download NAP Cytoscape files To download NAP's Cytoscape file, go back to the results page of your task: and download the compacted file containing the 'structure_graph_alt.xgmml' file. After the download, remember to uncompress the file for downstream use. Installing the ChemViz plugin To visualize the structures on NAP output we need the ChemViz plugin. The easiest way to install it is using Cytoscape's App Manager, as shown below: Load NAP Cytoscape file and apply layout Load the 'structure_graph_alt.xgmml' file: and apply a layout to spread the nodes: Change image display properties and paint library match structure The 'structure_graph_alt.xgmml' file contains some pre-set elements to aid structure display. Nodes possessing a structure are empty squares. Node borders are either green (spectral library match) or blue (in silico prediction). In silico predictions can be a combination of MetFrag, Fusion and Consensus. Browsing the 'Table Panel' is possible to inspect which scoring method has structures available in the columns MetFrag/Fusion/ConsensusSMILES. To use one of these columns to display the structures we have first to change the properties of ChemViz, by doing: After setting the desired source column to display the structure one can just 'paint' the structure on the node: Change display properties and paint on multiple nodes As we described in the publications below we have a decreasing order of confidence on structural prediction spectral library match Fusion scoring Consensus scoring MetFrag scoring. To change for Fusion scoring structures you can do: and paint the structures: Display the list of candidates As discussed in the Online Exploration section, the most correct structure may not be the first candidate. Therefore we can display the structures outputted from our initial parameters : Citation da Silva, Ricardo R., Mingxun Wang, Louis-F\u00e9lix Nothias, Justin JJ van der Hooft, Andr\u00e9s Mauricio Caraballo-Rodr\u00edguez, Evan Fox, Marcy J.

This visualization approach can detect sets of spectra from related molecules (molecular networks), even when the spectra themselves are not matched to any known compounds. The visualization of molecular networks in GNPS represents each spectrum as a node, and spectrum-to-spectrum alignments as edges (connections) between nodes. Nodes can be supplemented with metadata, including dereplication matches or information that is provided by the user, e.g. as abundance, origin of product, biochemical activity, or hydrophobicity, which can be reflected in a node\u2019s size or color. This map of all related molecules is visualized as a global molecular network. For more information about Molecular Networking check out the GNPS publication from 2016. Data Input Preparation The follow data is can be put into molecular networking. Mass Spectrometry data files (required) Metadata/Group Mapping (optional) `ili 3D mapping files (optional) Mass Spectrometry data files Molecular networking supports mzXML, mzML, and mgf file formats. To convert your file to the appropriate formats, check out our documentation . Metadata The metadata file describes the samples properties and allows more flexibility for data analysis and visualization. It is an alternative way to assign groups when selecting data input files within the workflow of GNPS. The current version of molecular networking allows to use the metadata table as an input. Although it is possible to use the legacy group mapping and attribute mapping file, we strongly advise to prepare metadata table instead. Format The metadata table is a text file (Tab separated) that users must create these file themselves using a text editor (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Notepad++ for Windows, gedit for Linux, TextWrangler for Mac OS). Using Metadata table can greatly ease the visualization and analysis of data within Cytoscape. We strongly encourage you to prepare those in advance and to share it publicly with your MassIVE data. You can download an example and edit it appropriately. Finally users will need to upload just as you would upload data input files and select it in the metadata table file upload selection. For a metadata table file template, you can use the following .txt file - Right-click, and Save link as . The only required columns in the metadata is \"filename\". NOTE: capitalization matters. Metadata columns that will be considered by molecular networking must be prefixed by \"ATTRIBUTE_\". Please ensure that the file is saved as a tab separated text file. Excel (xlsx), rich text (rtf) are not acceptable. For Qiita users that wish to reconcile sample identifiers so that the biom and metadata output are compatible with Qiita, please provide an extra column (#SampleID). GNPS will understand this extra metadata column and rewrite sample identifers for BIOM and metadata to this sample identifier rather than using the mass spectrometry filename by default. Pardon our dust as we are migrating this documentation, if we missed anything, please check out our Legacy Documentation . `ili 3D Mapping Files The metadata can also be used to specify spatial coordinates for direct visualization of the data in 'ili toolbox . Note that an .STL binary file must selected as an input in the workflow. The following headers are required: \"COORDINATE_X\" - X coordinate on the 2D/3D model \"COORDINATE_Y\" - Y coordinate on the 2D/3D model \"COORDINATE_Z\" - Z coordinate on the 2D/3D model \"COORDINATE_radius\" - radius for the spot in 'ili toolbox. Additionally, a 3D STL file will need to be provided to visualize all the molecule intensities onto. It creates really cool plots like this: Legacy Group and Attribute Mapping Format This format has been replaced by the above Metadata format. While it is still supported it is not recommended. Please see the details here . Running Molecular Networking Molecular Networking Workflow Selection From the main GNPS page , click the \"Create Molecular Network\" button. This will bring you to the workflow input to start networking. Provide a detailed title for your molecular network. This title will be helpful when you retrieve your data after the workflow is completed. Selecting Files to Analyze Select files for analysis by first clicking \"Select Input Files\". This bring a popup window. We can select our own files to analyze. Alternatively, we can import an existing public dataset if we know the dataset accession ( Browse Datasets ). From the Select Input Files popup, you will be a shares files tab. There you will find a box called Import Data Share. In this box you may enter an accession of a MassIVE dataset. Upon clicking import the dataset will appear in your workspace to select input files to analyze from. Organizing Selected Files into Groups By default, files can be categorized into separate groups (G1, G2, etc.). For example, case and control or two different microbes can be separate groups. Using the basic options, only six groups can be created. Individual files or entire folders can be selected. Click Finish Selection which will close the pop-up window. Parameter Walkthrough Basic Options Parameter Description Default Precursor ion mass tolerance (PIMT) Parameter used for MS-Cluster and spectral library search. Specify the precursor ions mass tolerance, in Daltons. This value influences the aforementioned clustering of nearly-identical MS/MS spectra via MS-Cluster. Note that the value of this parameters should be consistent with the capabilities of the mass spectrometer and the specific instrument method used to generated the MS/MS data. Recommended Values value is \u00b1 0.02 Da for high-resolution instruments (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap) and \u00b1 2.0 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ). 2.0 Fragment Ion Mass Tolerance (FIMT) Parameters used for MS-Cluster, molecular networking, and MS/MS spectral library searches. For every group of MS/MS spectra being considered for clustering (consensus spectrum creation), this value specifies how much fragment ions can be shifted from their expected m/z values. Recommended Values value is \u00b1 0.02 Da for high-resolution instruments (q-TOF, q-Orbitrap) and \u00b1 0.5 Da for low-resolution instruments (ion traps, QqQ). 0.5 Advanced Network Options Parameter Description Default Notes Min Pairs Cos Minimum cosine score that must occur between a pair of consensus MS/MS spectra in order for an edge to be formed in the molecular network. 0.7 Lower value will increase the size of the clusters by inducing the clustering of less related MS/MS spectra, higher value will limit do the opposite. Minimum Matched Fragment Ion (Min Matched Peaks) Parameters used for molecular networking. Is the minimum number of common fragment ions that are shared by two separate consensus MS/MS spectra in order to be connected by an edge in the molecular network 6 A low value will permit linkages between spectra of molecules with few similar fragment ions, but it will result in many more less-related spectra being connected to the network. An higher value will do the opposite. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be adjusted depending on the experimental conditions for mass spectra acquisition (such as mode of ionisation, fragmentation conditions, and the mobile phase, ...), and the collision-induced fragmentation behavior of the molecules of interest within the samples. High molecular weight (MW) compounds, and compounds with more hetero-atoms will generally tend to produce more fragment ions. However, this rule cannot be systematized. For example, some lipids with high MW generate only few fragment ions. Node TopK Maximum number of neighbor nodes for one single node 10 The edge between two nodes are kept only if both nodes are within each other's \u2018TopK\u2019 most similar nodes. For example, if this value is set at 20, then a single node may be connected to up to 20 other nodes. Keeping this value low makes very large networks (many nodes) much easier to visualize. Minimum Cluster Size Minimum number of MS/MS spectra in a consensus MS/MS spectra to be considered for molecular networking 2 Requires MS-Cluster to be on. This parameter should be tuned based on the dataset size. See presets below Run MSCluster Cluster MS/MS spectra before networking Yes MSCluster will analyze every MS/MS spectra resulting from ions that fall within the defined precursor ion mass tolerance, and will merge the nearly-identical MS/MS spectra (above the cosine score) into a single consensus MS/MS spectrum. Each consensus MS/MS spectrum usually consist of multiple MS/MS spectra from across multiple LC-MS runs (or data files) Maximum Connected Component Size Maximum size of nodes allowed in a single connected network 100 Maximum size of nodes allowed in a single connected network. Nodes within a single connected molecular network will be separated by increasing cosine threshold for that specific connected molecular network. Default value is 100. Use 0 to allow an unlimited number of nodes in a single network. Note that with large datasets, or when a great number of related molecules are in the dataset, this value should be higher (or turn to 0) to retain as much information as possible. Downstream, these larger networks can be visualized using Cytoscape layout algorithms that can increase the intra-network clustering, allowing to visualize spectral groups in the network despite the number of nodes in the network. Metadata File Text input to describe experimental setup Replaces both Group mapping and Attribute Mapping Group Mapping Input text file organizing input files into groups Input text file organizing input files into groups. used as a more flexible alternative to assigning groups during data input selection. Attribute Mapping Attribute mapping eases visualization of different groups within cytoscape Input text file organizing groups into attributes Advanced Library Search Options Parameter Description Default Library Search Min Matched Peaks Minimum number of common fragment ions that MS/MS spectra should contain in order to be considered for spectral library annotation. Default value is 6, but note that this parameters should be tuned depending of the molecule of interest, and the experimental conditions (such as the ionisation mode, and the fragmentation conditions, ...). For example, collision-induced fragmentation of some lipids produce only few fragment ions. A lower value will allow clustering of MS/MS spectra containing less fragment ions, however it will also induce clustering of MS/MS spectra from different molecular-type to be connected in one network. An higher value will do the opposite 6 Score Threshold Minimum cosine score that MS/MS spectra should get in spectral matching with MS/MS spectral libraries in order to be considered an annotation. 0.7 Search Analogs Will search data for analogs to library spectra Don't Search Maximum Analog Search Mass Difference Maximum mass shift between library and putative analog found 100 (Da) Advanced Filtering Options Parameter Description Default Notes Filter stdDev Intensity Deprecated 0 Not recommended to change Minimum Fragment Ion Intensity All fragment ions in the MS/MS spectrum below this raw intensity will be deleted. By default, no filter. 0 Reduce to 0 if your data's raw intensities are very low. Filter Precursor Ion Window All peaks in a +/- 17 Da around precursor ion mass are deleted. By default, yes filter. This removes the residual precursor ion, which is frequently observed in MS/MS spectra acquired on qTOFs. Filter Filter library Apply peak filters to library Filter Filter peaks in 50Da Window Filter out peaks that are not top 6 most intense peaks in a +/- 50Da window Filter Turn off if your data is very small molecules as it might filter out a lot peaks in the lower mass ranges that might be signal. Parameter Presets We have several parameter presets that seem to work well depending on the dataset size. Small datasets - up to 5 LC/MS files Medium Datasets - 5 to 400 LC/MS files Large Datasets - 400+ LC/MS files Big Data(sets) - Lets talk!

To view the quality of the MS/MS match, click \"View Mirror Match\" to display a mirror plot View All Clusters With IDs View All Clusters allow a user to view the all consensus spectra in the molecular networking analysis. While Molecular Networking matches to all public reference libraries, the majority of molecules detected in untargeted LC/MS runs are unidentified. To help annotate these unidentified spectra, click the \"AnnotatetoGNPS\" to be taken to the view that allows you to choose a specific MS/MS spectrum to annotate. Then Click \"AnnotatetoGNPS\" to be taken to the annotation page with the spectrum prepopulated. Check out the details about annotation - Annotation Documentation . To view all the input MS/MS spectra that went into the consensus spectrum, click the link in the \"ClusterIdx\" link This brings up all the input MS/MS spectra. To visualize each spectrum, we can click the \"View Spectrum\" button. View Spectral Families View Spectra Families allows users to look at the molecular networks at a higher level. Users can see all the distinct spectral families that comprise the entire molecular network. These spectral families are all the nodes that are connected to each other. From here users can tell how big each component is, how many raw spectra are captured by the particular component, and also the libraries identifications of all the spectra in each component. To visualize each network, click on the \"Visualize Network\" link This brings up an in-browser visualization for a given spectral family Here users can explore the specific spectral family in the molecular network. Each circle (node) in the left network panel represents a consensus spectrum and edge represents related fragmentation patterns. The default color of the nodes is gray, with blue nodes representing consensus MS/MS spectra that were identified by library search. There is a lot to unpack in this online interface to explore the molecular networks.

Node Labels Label Description cluster index cluster index used globally for each cluster across all networking views parent mass precursor mass of the consensus spectrum LibraryID library identification name for the node if a library search were performed EvenOdd 1/0 for even or odd depending on the parent mass. Used for nitrogen rule Peptide peptide labeling None No Labeling Edge Labels Label Description Cosine Cosine score measuring fragmentation similarity between two nodes DeltaMZ The Delta MZ of the spectra None No Labeling Node Pie Coloring An additional way to customize the view of the networks is to color the nodes. By default the nodes are gray, but users can color the nodes based upon spectra counts of the groups they came from. By default the coloring labels will be based upon the default groups G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, and G6. The coloring of each node will be a pie, and the proportion colored of that pie is the proportion of the spectral counts coming from each respective group. Additionally, the Node Coloring legend describes the color for each group. Users can also use their own group names if they defined their own arbitrary groups when creating the network. To draw the pies, click \"Draw Pies\" Edge Highlights Edges by default include arrows pointing from low mass spectra to high mass spectra. Further, edges can also be colored. Users are able to enter a delta mz of their choice to highlight in the network. The highlighted edges will appear in red. Edge Directions The arrows between nodes in the molecular network point from higher m/z spectra to lower m/z spectra. This can facilitate tracking down identifying multiple extensions of a polymer or extension of a carbon chain. Edge Delta Histogram This histogram shows the distribution of the edge deltas. Clicking each peak in the histogram allows for highlighting the edges in the network. Node Sizing/Color The nodes size and color can be adjusted based upon several options: Spectrum counts Precursor intensity Number of Files Parent Mass Nitrogen Even/Odd Precursor Charge MS2 Peak Search in Molecular Network To search for specific molecules in the molecular network that contain an MS2 fragment of interest, you can enter a product ion m/z you want to find. First, we need to grab all the MS/MS spectra into the browser by clicking this button: Then, we can enter the m/z we want to search for and click the update button. This will highlight which molecules contain the specific product ion. We can also see a histogram of all product ions from all MS2 spectra in the current network. Detailed Interrogation of Network Spectra While its great to visualize the network properly, to truly make sense of the network users must be able to interrogate the network metadata and examine the actual spectra. To this end, users are able to find out information about a particular node by simply hovering their mouse over node. This will bring up a hover box describing the node information. At present the display shows like this: This shows basic information about the node, as well as the structure if the node is identified by library search and the structure was provided in the library spectrum. To further investigate the network, users can left click on a node to plot the spectrum in the top right panel (right click to plot in bottom right panel), along with the spectrum information and structure if one is available. The spectrum image is interactive so users can zoom in and look at precisely at the spectrum to make sense of the data. Additionally users can compare two spectra in the network by simple right clicking on a different node to render its information in the bottom right panel. Users can also click on an edge and both nodes that are connected to the edge are automatically displayed in the top and bottom right panels. Examining Spectrum Spectrum Alignment Users can quickly ascertain how two spectra align to each other at the peak level. By clicking the \"Align Spec\" button to obtain the score between the spectrum in the top and the spectrum in the bottom render panels. Additionally, the plots of the spectra will update to reflect the alignments shown here: with red peaks representing peaks that match at the exact same masses between the top and bottom spectra, and blue peaks representing peaks matching at shifted masses. Additionally, each peak is labeled with a unique identification number that shows the correspondence of peak matches between the top and bottom spectra. Network Spectra Library Matches To view how exactly a spectrum in the network has matched to a library spectrum, users can click the \"Show Library Match\" in the side panel on the far right. This will bring up this middle panel shown below comparing the spectrum in the network with the library spectrum in green. Network Screen Shot Download screenshot of the molecular network.

Spectral Similarity Related to Molecular Structure Similarity A key concept in tandem mass spectrometry is that repeated MS/MS acquisitions of a molecule under the same experimental conditions (e.g. same instrument, collision energy, abundance, charge state) will yield highly similar MS/MS spectra. That is, fragmentation of molecules is consistent. This enables the identification of MS/MS spectra to libraries of reference compounds. Extending this concept, we have observed that structurally related molecules also exhibit similar fragmentation, with some caveats. Intuitively, two molecules that differ by the addition of a single chemical moiety, which does not contribute to a significant difference in molecule mass and not drastically change the bond energies of the molecule (e.g. Oxidation, methylation, glycosylation), will not drastically perturb the gas phase chemistry of fragmentation. Given that relative bond strengths between the two molecules do not drastically differ, the same bonds will undergo similar fragmentation within the collision cell of the mass spectrometer. The resulting corresponding product ions in the MS/MS spectra from the two molecules will either include the additional chemical moiety or will not. In cases fragments do not, the chemical moiety could either have Not been part of the product ion substructure Cleaved off prior to product ion formation Since corresponding product ions between structurally similar molecules can either have moiety or not, the product ions can either Appear at the exact same mass for both molecules Appear shifted by the mass of the chemical moiety Watrous et al. PNAS We consider both of these possibilities for each and every peak between two MS/MS spectra and explore how we do that below. Spectrum Alignment We will use a toy example here to demonstrate intuitively how we are able to consider an alignment between two MS/MS spectra. Given two molecules that differ by a single chemical moiety that each produce fragmentation as shown We can consider that each peak from molecule A, could align at the same mass in molecule B, or at an offset of Mass(Delta). One possible alignment is all peaks in A, align at the same mass Another, where the first peak aligns at the same mass, the second at an offset Third, where the first peak aligns at an offset, and the second aligns at the same mass Finally, where both peaks align at an offset All of these potential alignments can be explored and the best scoring alignment is determined between the two MS/MS spectra and is called the alignment score. The total number of potential alignments is exponential (2 ^ N, where N is the number of peaks) and is computationally expensive. GNPS has implemented algorithms that can efficiently approximate this alignment. Alignment of Entire Dataset So far we've investigated how to align one MS/MS spectrum to another, but have not created molecular networks across an entire dataset of MS/MS spectra. Since we do not know a priori, which MS/MS spectra will be structurally similar to any others, we must try aligning all MS/MS spectra within a dataset to all others. GNPS calculates the score between all MS/MS spectra within a dataset that provides the starting point of a molecular network. Network Filtering for Visualization The alignments between all MS/MS spectra must be filtered in order to produce molecular networks that can be visualized and interpretable. Alignment Score Filtering The most basic filter is by alignment score between MS/MS spectra. Generally, the default of cosine of 0.7 and 6 minimum matches peaks reduces the number of false positive alignments tremendously. Neighbor Top K A pathological case in Molecular Networks are promiscuous MS/MS spectra that align to many other MS/MS spectra due to a low complexity of fragmentation. To counteract this, only retain alignments between alignments between MS/MS spectra that mutually rank each other highly in the alignment score. Just like in human relationships, who wants a best friend who has a million other best friends? Connected Component Max Size Even with the above filters, the occasional false positive connections causes hairball networks that make visualization/interpretation difficult. The connected component size filter limits the maximum size of a single molecular network to a parameterized number of nodes (100 by default). This process iteratively breaks up large hairball networks by removing the lowest scoring alignments (by cosine score) first until the resulting pieces fall below the maximum size. Limitation of Molecular Networking Multiple Modifications Molecular networking is unable to align spectra from molecules that differ by two distinct structural modifications. We have observed that this limitation is ameliorated in biological datasets because chemical modifications are enzymatically catalyzed. In the event that two molecules differ by two distinct chemical modification which cannot be connected by molecular networking, an intermediate molecule which differs by only a single chemical modification to the respective molecules and links all three molecules into a molecular family.","title":"Molecular Networking"},{"location":"massspecbackground/networkingtheory/#molecular-networking-theory","text":"While there are many publications out there giving algorithmic and intuition into molecular networking, we attempt a cliff notes version here.","title":"Molecular Networking Theory"},{"location":"massspecbackground/networkingtheory/#spectral-similarity-related-to-molecular-structure-similarity","text":"A key concept in tandem mass spectrometry is that repeated MS/MS acquisitions of a molecule under the same experimental conditions (e.g. same instrument, collision energy, abundance, charge state) will yield highly similar MS/MS spectra.
